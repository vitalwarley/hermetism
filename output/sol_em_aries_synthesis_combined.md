These shifts illuminate the evolving interpretations of authority and power in the context of social changes.


### Tarot Card Information Extraction:

#### Card Description:
The cards depicted are part of the "Tarocchino di Bologna," specifically the "Quatro Mouros" or "Four Moors." These cards were painted by Antonio di Maria in 1740 and replaced the traditional Major Arcana of the Empress, Emperor, Papissa (High Priestess), and Pope with four noble figures, symbolizing conflict between the Church and the City-State of Bologna.

#### Symbolism:
- **Nobility**: The four figures represent noble status and are intricately detailed in their attire, signifying high rank.
- **Conflict and Change**: The replacement of significant arcana indicates a shift in power dynamics, reflecting historical conflicts.

- **Transformation**: Implies a period of change, challenging traditional roles and beliefs.

  - **Air**: Represents thoughts and intellect (likely Emperor).
  - **Earth**: Tied to stability and practical matters (possibly the Empress).

#### Interpretive Guidance:
- When drawing these cards, seek to understand your current power dynamics and how external influences affect your decision-making.
- Reflect on significant changes in leadership or authority in your life and consider how these shifts influence your path.
- Embrace the potential for transformation by acknowledging what structures in your life may need to be disrupted or replaced.

### Visual Elements Analysis:
- **Figures’ Attire**: Each noble’s clothing matches the thematic colors often associated with wealth and status, enhancing the luxurious aspect of the tarot's interpretation.
- **Accessories (Scepters, Arrows)**: These represent authority and direction, highlighting the leadership aspect of the figures depicted.
- **Background Elements**: The inclusion of celestial symbols (like the sun) suggests a greater cosmic influence on the earthly matters represented by the figures.
- **Art Style**: The card illustrations have a distinct historical artistic style, indicative of the cultural milieu of 18th-century Italy, emphasizing the interconnectivity of art and esoteric traditions.

This comprehensive understanding of the "Quatro Mouros" not only aids in tarot readings but also contextualizes the societal changes of the time, allowing for deeper introspection during tarot practices.

Thoth Emperor Tarot Card Tutorial
Thoth Emperor Tarot Card Tutorial
My new YouTube channel is : Thoth Tarot Videos. The Thoth Emperor Video can be viewed clicking the image link below:
(ii) Thoth Emperor
The word Emperor means “he who sets in order”  and the Thoth Emperor looks towards the Empress. The Empress stands for the universal, the totality and the LOVE that binds creation. The Emperor is Lord of his personal Universe (Kingdom) and yet in his rulership over others has to learn that self sacrifice is necessary to be a great ruler.
The Emperors body forms the shape of a Triangle on a Cross as in the image below. This is also the symbol for SULPHUR. and dominant red colour of the card represents the astrological association of Mars in Aries.
(iii) Thoth Emperor Mythology
He is consort to the Empress and faces her. She is Venus (Aphrodite) and he is the God Mars. Venus, the Goddess of Love has a passionate affair with Mars, the God of War:
The Emperor being a ruler understands what can and cannot be controlled or changed. His success is based on his ability to know the difference between the two and make wise choices. To remain in power he must meet the needs of others as well as his own. He is Atu 4 which represents stability and security.
The lesson of the Emperor is that in order to conquer you must also serve and you must also father any offspring. This latter statement relates both to actions in the world (which have consequences) and well as in creating a family through the Empress. We need to make sure that what we create is of the highest virtue possible. Christ sacrificed himself for the higher good, and so the Emperor must learn that true gain comes through surrender.
(iii) Rider Waite Emperor
The Rider Waite Emperor sits upon a large stone throne, with four rams’ heads carved into it (symbolic of his connection with Aries and the planet Mars). In his right hand, the Emperor holds an ankh, the Egyptian symbol of life, and in his left is an orb representing the world over which he has dominion.
Thoth Emperor & The Tree of Life
Path 28: The Path of Natural Intelligence
Natural relating to those ‘vital’ or life forces which exist in Yesod and Netzach which will be expanded upon below.
In the Book of Thoth the explanation is that the white light in the far right corner represents the wisdom of Chokmah, which is the Emperors authority, and this is directed upon Tiphareth, the heart of man. This is traditionally the path of the Emperor on the Tree of Life, however as we see in the next section he later swaps the position of the Emperor with the Star !
So updated,  the Emperor sits on the path between Netzach and Yesod.
Netzach = ruled by Venus which links him the Empress. This relates to the emotions, enjoyment, pleasure, bliss.
Yesod = the final FILTER through which the forces of the Tree of Life are organised before being manifested in the final sephiroth MALKUTH. Yesod is also associated with ASTRAL LIGHT which is what the occult magicians manipulate. Its corresponding chakra is the root chakra which is associated with sexuality and drive as see below:
From this we can conclude that the Emperor regulates his emotions and desires and redirects his sexual energy to manipulate what he wants to happen in the world. This is similar to the Yogi who awakens the Kundalini through redirection of his sexual energies. This is another example of the ‘sacrifice’ the Emperor makes for the greater good, which can happen from the physical to the spiritual levels.
Thoth Emperor Hebrew Attribution and Astrology
The Hebrew alphabet was originally written in PICTOGRAPH script. The pictograph for Tzaddi is a drawing of a man on his side:
Tzaddi = subsequently got defined as ‘fish hook’ which resembles its shape when Hebrew letters were defined:
However the word ‘fishing’ can be used as a metaphor in daily life for ‘searching for information’, often into the unknown. This describes the act of meditation in which we are searching for answers into our spiritual nature in the depths of the waters of the divine, and so this is how the Hebrew association is linked to this cards meaning.
Thoth Emperor Symbolism
A summary of the main symbolic elements to this card is given in the image below:
Triangle above cross = domination of spirit over matter. Also sulphur is the fiery element of the universe according to Crowley. Can be volatile and fiery. Active personality, not passive.
Crown = has 4 points representing Chesed. The jewels also have 4 facets to them. His Gold Crown is symbolic of the sun which is behind him and this is relevant as the Emperor is associated astrologically to Aries. The sun is exalted in Aries.
Number Four = seen by the shape of the Emperors legs. This stands for Chesed, the fourth sephiroth on the Tree of Life.
This strong association with Chesed is also represented by the image of the Thoth Emperor himself. The archetypal image of Chesed is as below. The sephiroth Chesed is ruled by Jupiter:
Orb with Maltese Cross above = this is in his left hand and is over the naval chakra or pro creative area. This symbolises his creative energy and ability to govern.
Bees on garment = energy, industriousness. Bees are also very organised and so this represents his ability to govern others. A leader.
Looping lines terminating in arrowheads = directed energy and activity to specific tasks. The Emperor does not waste energy but directs it to gets things accomplished.
Star Disk on throne = these are on each arm of the throne. There are 16 points on each star and this is the atomic number of sulphur:
Sixteen = is also the gematria of CHACH, hook, which is the meaning of Tzaddi and is the number of points on the stars adorning the Emperors throne:
Fleur-de-lis = a symbol of rulership from the French monarchy thus emphasising the theme of rulership in this card.
Alchemical Attributes of the Emperor
Alchemically the Emperor is SULPHUR which is one of the three forms of alchemical energy with Mercury and SALT being the other two. SULFHUR is seen as the active part of Nature that stimulates Salt, maintaining the equilibrium of the Universe. Sulphur is masculine, active, and fiery and a vehicle for the manifestation of energy into form, hence the links with Chesed in this card.
Sceptre with Rams Head = held so it receives light from the right side of the card and this is channelled down to the shield. Rams head represents Aries.
Shield = red tincture representing purified sulphur analogous to Gold and the Sun compared to Silver and the Moon in the shield of the Thoth Empress. So both cards have contrasting energies.
Golden Eagle with 2 Heads = similar to the phoenix and has regenerative powers. The red disk behind them
Lamb and Flag = (Agnus Dei) = the Lamb of God. The lamb was often a blood sacrifice in the Old Testament and is a Christian symbol for Christs Sacrifice for others. This represents the old Aeon of Osiris which was referenced in my article on the Three Aeons of Thelema. The lamb here is tamed and subservient to the Emperor. It has lost its independence and drive.
So we can say that alchemy rules in this card because looking at the brightness, the left corner of the shield in much brighter than the darker right corner. This emphasises Crowley’s vision of alchemy being the foundation of the tarot and the New Aeon of Horus, rather than the traditional association with the Ram, Aries and religion. This process is summed up in the image below:
The Empress to Emperor Transition
The Thoth Emperor symbolises leadership, responsibility, self control, discipline and focus. Once we have set out our spiritual path goals with the Magus and connected with the soul in the Priestess, tasted the LOVE inside with the Empress, we must take responsibility for our life and actions in the Emperor stage. The Emperor is not about shrinking violets, and the same goes with any spiritual path. We must stand for something and live our lives accordingly or we stand for nothing. And yet, like the Emperor we must understand the importance of self sacrifice for the greater good. In the same way we must sacrifice our individuality or soul Atman, into the great Oneness (Brahman)
This stage also involves fostering a discipline on our spiritual journal. There are potentially many distractions in the world and we learn self discipline and focus in this stage. We must take up personal responsibility for our spiritual journey.
Thoth Emperor Divinatory Meanings
Emperor Upright Meanings
You may be taking on responsibility for others, perhaps with family members who rely on you for their security.
A natural leader and organiser working from a point of fairness with others. You prefer to be your own boss or a leader of others rather than a follower.
If you are currently have life problems, the Emperor encourages you to take responsibility, breaking problems down into smaller manageable chunks and work systematically through them.
He also symbolises someone who has lived through many life lessons and can now use that knowledge and life experience to help others.
Success through self discipline and application, thinking logically/ rationally.
Learning to sacrifice yourself for a greater cause. Only by surrender do we gain spiritually.
Emperor Reversed Meanings
Perhaps you are not sticking to your goals and have not applied the necessary focus and discipline to see them through.
Being under the influence of an overly dominant figure who stifles your creativity. Your partner may be overbearing and possessive.
Poor relationship with your father. Over intellectualizing a situation. Lack of ambition and direction.
Wanting to break free from a situation which has you tied to rules and regulations. You might like to express yourself more openly, perhaps becoming self employed if it is work situation.
Looking at your spiritual path from the point of view of what you can get rather than what you can give.
Over controlling and dominant. Cruel, violent or insecure. Suppressing your feminine/softer side.
Thoth Emperor in the Celtic Cross Spread
1: Heart of the Situation = have you got control over your life and the direction it is heading ?
2: Possible obstacle = not structuring your time and goals well enough so life becomes chaotic. If in a spiritual context, you need to give and sacrifice yourself more, as this is the true nature of the spiritual journey.
3: Unconscious Influences = Feel protective over others and often take on the ‘parenting’ role in order to help them.
4: Recent Past = a period of discipline and hard work.
5: Hopes and goals = to be your own boss, self employed. Free from the negative influences of others. Wishing to become a parent.
6: Short Term Future = need to focus on a task and organize your time effectively to achieve it. If a situation seems too big to handle, break it down into manageable tasks.
7: Our Self Image = organised, efficient, leader, business like, goal orientated.
8: How others see you (reversed) = controlling, overly dominant.
9: Guidance & Warning = need to be balanced whilst working to your goals otherwise your life will become barren like the background of the Rider Waite card.  Dont over intellectualize things. Learn to sacrifice your time for the benefit of others and make sure what you create is potentially for the benefit of all (Karma).
10: Overall Outcome = material security, stability, achieving your goals through hard work and focussed effort. Learning to surrender in meditation and by giving we receive far more.

Two of Wands Thoth Tarot Card Tutorial
(i) Two of Wands YouTube Video
Two of Wands : My in-depth YouTube Video on the Two of Wands of the Thoth Tarot deck may be viewed below.
(ii) Thoth Two of Wands
There are 6 flames behind the wands & a blue and red specked background.
Dominion originates from the root word ‘Domain’ which  traditionally relates to land or a territory belonging to a ruler such as a King or Queen.
In the context of this card it implies rulership over our own life and empowerment of the self, which are concepts central to the divinatory meanings.
Do we have a domain (a centre within) from which we have confidence and self-assurance?
(iii) Golden Dawn Two of Wands
(iv) Rider Waite Two of Wands
You have been able to take your inspiration (Ace of Wands) and turn it into a feasible plan (Two of Wands) which has the potential to be successful.
(v) Numerology of the Two of Wands
Number 1 (Monad, Point) Ace of Wands = perfect unity with NO dimensions of its own (see Leibniz Monadology). However, when combined with other points it has the power to express its potential by creating new dimensions. Thus the Aces of the Minor Arcana are representing PURE POTENTIAL of KETHER which may or may not be realised.
Number 2: (DUAD): here we have duality coming out of the unity of Kether, with 2 points created. These are joined to form a LINE and therefore this interaction can produce either conflict or cooperation within the Twos of the minor arcana.
In the Two of Wands this relates to the decision making process and planning, being at a crossroads in ones life and making appropriate choices with which this card is associated in divinatory terms.
(vi) Two of Wands The Tree of Life & Four Worlds
The Tree of Life
The Two of Wands,as with all the Twos is associated with the second sephiroth Chokmah meaning ‘Wisdom’. Like all the Wands it is in the world of Atziluth (the world of inspiration). So the Two of Wands qabalistically infers that the person has to apply wisdom in their future choices/ direction in which their life will subsequently take, and yet these choices must align with what inspires them (From the Ace of Wands). You can now see how the two cards are related.
The Four Worlds
This card relates to Chokmah in Atziluth or the world of Fire. All the Wands are found in the first world, but each have a different sephira within that world:
Chokmah is the second Sephiroth and the masculine component of the supernal triangle and is known as the CROWN OF CREATION  and therefore not part of the manifest universe.
It represents the IMPULSE of manifestation from Kether. Its feminine counterpart is Binah, the third sephiroth, the 3 being represented by the 3 leaves on the staffs of the two of wands in the Rider Waite Card. The twos represent balance and harmony which is established in Binah with male and female energies coming together.
Chokhmah is assigned the colour GREY which is a mixture of black and white, the colors assigned to Binah and Kether respectively.
Grey therefore symbolises the unification of opposites, balance, harmony, neutrality.
Chokmah is ruled not by one planet but the ZODIAC ITSELF. Therefore we have to have balance achieved by integrating the different energies expressed in the zodiac.
In the same way the two of wands indicates that our path to success arises from bringing together various ideas of inspiration into a plan and goal for the future, so we can create a world (Globe in the Rider Waite Card) which we want, rather than be a victim of circumstance.
Chokmah in the suit of Fire = Will in its most potent form acting without ‘caring’about the consequences.
Chokmah is the force in the creative process arising from the potentail of the Ace in Kether, and as it flows through the Two of Wands it combines with the fire of the suit.  So FORCE + FIRE imply a powerful energy associated with this card, which is backed up by its astrology.
(vii) Astrology of the Two of Wands
Mars in Aries
The Two of Wands is associated with the first decan of Aries ( 0 – 10 degrees), ruled by Mars
Mars: the planet of vitality, energy and assertion.
Aries: exploration, pioneering
Card implies we will have the energy to move in new directions if we want (Aries) from a place of balance and harmony (the two), and with confidence and assertion (Mars).
(xiii) Symbolism of the Two of Wands
Dorjes = Tibetan symbol for ‘thunderbolt’ or lightning bolt. Below is an example of crystal Quartz Dorjes:
Heads of Dorjes = Tibetan symbols showing change and disruption when force acts.
Snakes on arrowheads = change and renewal as a result of acting dynamically with force. The force in this card has the power to change things, get things moving.
Flames in centre = 6 in number. Representing the 6th sephiroth Tiphareth of which the Sun rules. The Sun is exhaled in Aries, the sign of the card. So as well as Mars ruling Aries, Aries also benefits from the Sun here giving a strong Arian influence e.g. pioneer going out in the world getting things done.
Blue Background = clarity showing through after force acts. Sometimes a situation needs taking by the ‘scruff of the neck’ to find clarity.
In summary, to interpret this card we have the idea of the force of the 2 strong wands and the association with Chokmah which is force, and yet we have the balance of the 2 here as well as the creativity from the Sun influence.
So the Two of Wands might indicate a situation in which there might well be some upheaval ( thunderbolts) before clarity (blue background) and harmony  is established (Tiphareth as middle sephiroth on the Tree of Life).
(ix) Ace of Wands to Two of Wands Transition
The Ace of Wands holds the burst or spark of inspiration. It is there to show us we have potential for creative growth. The Two of Wands signifies we have used the potential contained within the Ace of Wands, discovered that which inspires us to our highest good, and now put our inner will into action by moving forward with a plan to make our future brighter and better.
(x) Geomancy & Two of Wands
Mars in Aries is attributed to the geomantic figure PUER
Puer  = This is Latin for “The Boy” and  is a representation of a sword or erect phallus and refers to male energies, primarily aggression and passion, but also war and male sexuality. It is aggressive in most cases and must be tempered to be used for positive effect. Astrologically it is associated with Aries and Mars. All elements are active except Water (double dots), the element of emotion; its inner element is air, but due to it being ruled by Mars, its outer element is fire. So water being passive in this figure means there is little to balance the male energy.
(xi) Shemhamphorasch Angels of the Two of Wands
Vehuel: Elaborates seed of human thought, elevation towards greatness and wisdom. Source of inspiration. Can be egotistical, overly passionate.
Daniel: Eloquence, grace, ability to materialize thoughts through deeds. Helps to see clearly, speaks well and diplomatically. Can be manipulative or like a negatively aspected Magician. Highly speech-oriented.
(xii) Divinatory Meanings of the Two of Wands
Two of Wands Upright
1.Planning a path forward in your life. The potential of the Ace of Wands has now become a direction. So this card indicates the need to make a plan for the future to achieve success.
2. Stepping out of your comfort zone and place of security in order to progress your life on to the next phase and set of experiences.
3. The urge to discover that there is more to life than you currently know. This card indicates that it is not a random process but that in order to move forward you have to make ideas concrete by turning inspiration into specific goals and writing them down to action them and make them more conscious.
4. Travel, career changes, a change of direction is indicated. You have an idea of what you want and you have the world in your hands to shape your path through your actions.
5. You may need to take a situation by the scruff of the neck which might be challenging with lots of changes but there will be a positive more balanced outcome.
Two of Wands Reversed
1. Not planning for the future and therefore you do not have a clear view of the way ahead. You need to slow down and organise your thoughts. Write down what inspires you and turn that into a practical plan of action.
2. You have had ideas for the future but not made an effective plan to make them a reality.
3. Sticking with familiar territory. You can see that there is much more to explore and experience in the world but you have your feet planted firmly in the safety of what you know. Fear and lack of confidence/planning allow your life to stagnate.
4. Loosing your passion and inspiration to achieving what you want in the world, or that goal becomes unclear. This indicates the need to slow down and get back in touch with what is really important in your life and re connect with that inner spirit which guides your life forward.
5. Wasting time and money in unproductive situations.
(xiii) Two of Wands in the Celtic Cross
Card 1: (Heart of Your Situation) –The need to take a situation by the ‘horns’ which might be uncomfortable at first but will lead to a better outcome one the disruption has settled.
Card 2: (Obstacles/Challenges) – not acting on that which inspires you.
Card 3: (Subconscious Influences) – you want to have plans for the future but are afraid to put them in to action so subconsciously you put things off.
Card 4: (Your Recent Past) – have had challenging circumstances but your persistence has paid off so that strength can be drawn on with confidence in your new situation.
Card 5: (Your Hopes & Goals) – to follow that which inspires you and change your current circumstances.
Card 6: (Your Immediate Future) –  the impulse to ‘go for it’ is calling you. Overcome any fears and move forward with your life to the next adventure/project.
Card 7: (Your Internal Self at this Time) – planning for the next stage of your life is essential at this time and connecting with what inspires you most.
Card 8: (Your External Environment) – challenging, competative, can be quite unsettling. Try and look for ways of re establishing harmony in your life by careful planning ahead.
Card 9: (Guidance and Warning) – If you are not acting upon and in harmony with that which most inspires you, then you will have a harder path realising your true potential
Card 10: (Your Overall Outcome) – by aligning with your deepest inspiration and careful planning to achieve your goals, you will realise you can realise your dreams and fulfill your potential.

Three of Wands Thoth Tarot Card Tutorial
(i) Three of Wands YouTube Video
My in-depth  Video on the Three of Wands is part of a Tarot Series on my Youtube Channel ‘Thoth Tarot Videos’  & the presentation for this card can be viewed by clicking on the image below:
(ii) Thoth Three of Wands
The three wands are crossed in the centre and have lotus blossoms that are opened and receptive.There are 10 straight and 10 curved flames in the background.
Wikipedia states : Virtue (Latin: virtus, Ancient Greek: ἀρετή “arete”) is moral excellence. A virtue is a positive trait or quality deemed to be morally good and thus is valued as a foundation of principle and good moral being. Other synonmys are:
kindness
morality
incorruptibility
honor, integrity
purity
trustworthiness
(iii) Rider Waite Three of Wands
(iv) Numerology and the Three of Wands
The symbol of three (TRIAD) is the triangle, the first geometrical figure and is two dimensional:
Threes occur in many aspects of life:
There are 3 phases to the moon.
Beginning, a middle and an end.
Three is birth, life, death.
Holy Trinity: Father, Son, Holy Ghost also represented by the Supernal Triangle of the Tree of Life
In Tarot we have
1.The Empress (Atu III), with the child being the third in the relationship.
2. Three of Swords (Sorrow) = love triangle or third person causing emotional pain as a possible interpretation.
3. Thoth Princes = associated with the third letter of the tetragrammaton VAU and are the product of the union of the Knight and Queen.
Hegel (1770 – 1831)  was a German Philosopher who was known for his Dialectic Theory:
Hegelian dialectic:
1.  Thesis, giving rise to its reaction,
2. Antithesis, which contradicts or negates the thesis;
3. Synthesis = a blending, or harand the tension between the two being resolved by means of a .
In more simplistic terms, one can consider it thus: problem → reaction → solution.
This can be applied to the Three of Wands in which we have the Ace of Wands (Inspiration- PROBLEM), Two of Wands (Our Plan based on our Inspiration-REACTION and the resultant Manifestation-SOLUTION:
With respect to the three of Wands, manifestation refers to Initial achievement of goals, growth, creativity, abundance, expression, communication and friendships based on virtuous actions.
(v) The Three of Wands, The Tree of Life and The 4 Worlds
(a) The Tree of Life
The 3 of Wands is associated with Binah, the 3rd Sephiroth highlighted in yellow, ruled by SATURN
(b) The Four Worlds
Binah in Atlizuth.  Binah is feminine and gives birth to FORM, shaping the outpouring of energy from Chockmah. It is associated with the supernal triangle in the first world so it is very close to its spiritual source in Kether. This purity is reflected in the name of the card as being Virtue, and implied in its meaning: striving to be the purest and best expression of who we can be in the world.
Crowley calls the card ‘Virtue’ and one reason is perhaps  due to the three of Wands being accociated with the sephiroth Binah in Aziluth, the latter being the highest (and purest) of the four worlds and so our thoughts and actions have to be for the highest good to accuratly represent the energy of this card.
Binah has both Light and Dark aspects. Light in that she is the giver of life but Dark in that intrinsic to Life is Death. She is often given the title of The Great Sea, water representing consciousness typically in relgious books such as the Bible. We see this pictorally in the 3 of Disks as the wavy lines around the 3-d shape:
Binah is allocated the planet SATURN – the ruler of TIME and associated with restrictions/discipline. It thus gives rise to the shape of form (creation) and its change (birth-life-death) over time.
(vi) Astrology of The Three of Wands
Sun in Aries
Sun in Aries = Spring time, renewal, birth,creation
The Sun is exhaled (strengthened) in Aries and so this placement is very favourable. This plays out in the Three of Wands in that the energy, enthusiasm and magnetism of the Sun pours through the active, optimistic and enterprising Aries leading to great buisness and life opportunities if we are connected to our highest good.
Decan:   2nd decan of Aries (11 – 20 degrees)
(vii) Symbolism of the Three of Wands
Consider the 3 of Wands in context with the Ace and Two of Wands in terms of the flames seen in each:
6 White Straight Flames = 6 is the influence of the SUN, the sun ruling the 6th sephiroth TIPHARETH
4 straight remaining flames = energy of the Dorjes in the 2 of wands. The flames are identical as shown in the 2 of wands picture below :
Golden Shafts of Wands = also represent the sun
10 curvy flames = those in the Ace of wands :
Lotus Wand = associated with ISIS = power of CREATION ( initial fruition of our buisness plans for example)
9 petals on Lotus Wand = linking them with creative Yesod (9th sephiroth ruled by the moon).
3 wands = unity of mind & heart with your actions which together with the newness represented by Sun in Aries = virtuous actions.
Sun in Aries = Spring time, renewal, birth,creation
So from the above we have themes of BIRTH & CREATION.
(viii) Two of Wands to Three of Wands Transition
Plans made in the 2 of Wands are followed through with the 3 of Wands.
The third wand in ‘Virtue’ equally divides the 2 Wands in ‘Dominion’
The initiative of the Ace is combined with the duality of the Two to to give the action of the 3 of Wands (Virtue).   Progress is now happening in your life after some frustration in the past trying to make sense with what direction your life was going in (2 of Wands).
The 3 Wands forms a triangle and when upright is the symbol for the element of Fire:
Unrestricted Firedesires to grow upwards and outwards  seeking to travel and expand its territory symbolising the growth that occurs in your life with this card. It may not be a life long happiness (Fires have a finite nature), but it points to a sense of contentment with what we are doing with our life at the moment.
(ix) Three of Wands and the I-Ching
Crowley relates the 3 of Wands to the 11th Hexagram T’AI meaning ‘HARMONY’. This association is made as this Hexagram is also ruled by the Sun in Aries.
T’ai relates to peace and harmony and life should currently be going well. Don’t take it for granted though. Examine all the aspects of your life and see how that harmony came about and how acting in your highest good might maintain that.  T’ai indicates a successful time of life. For further details use the link: James DeKorne
(x) Shemhamphorasch Angels & the Three of Wands
Hachashiah: Esoteric wisdom, medicine and healing. Goodness and understanding. Can abuse the good faith of others.
Imamiah: Ease in recognizing one’s errors. Easy execution of difficult work. Ardor, strength, vigor. Patience and courage, humility and simplicity. Can be rebellious, prideful, or blasphemous.
(xi) Divinatory Meanings of the Three of Wands
Wikipedia states : Virtue (Latin: virtus, Ancient Greek: ἀρετή “arete”) is moral excellence. A virtue is a positive trait or quality deemed to be morally good and thus is valued as a foundation of principle and good moral being. Other synonmys are:
kindness
morality
incorruptibility
honor, integrity
purity
trustworthiness
With Virtue, we have the direction in which the two of wands needs to be applied in order for her to be the best she can be and be of service to the world.Open lotus blossoms mean following what has meaning for us and following something from the heart. We have an understanding of our ‘virtues’ .. what we have to offer to the world in a useful way as well as being in tune with our highest principles.
Angel Paths says : “Virtue is about excellence – ethically and personally. It is about developing and maintaining high standards of behaviour, and then learning to have the confidence, self belief and strength of character to live out those standards through our every act.”
Three of Wands Upright
1.It is important for you to operate from a place of integrity before making decisions at the moment and make sure that you have clarity in mind and heart before acting in order to bring the best results. Unless you have clarity at this time, then do not act ! So if we have clarity – a great time to put our ideas into plan !
2.If we are having difficulty moving forward with a plan for your life, make a list of your virtues (positive traits). Open your heart (like the lotus blosoms in the card) and see what you connect with.
3.Using our skills constructively in the world that are a reflection of our highest good. This may relate to work in terms of our day job,hobbies, charity work, community work, spiritual studies/teaching or with respect to our friendships.
4.Behaving openly and honest with others , being a good listener and giving advice where appropriate from our highest perspective.
5.  Recent success of a project after some initial difficulties or creation of a new buisness project for example
Three of Wands Reversed
1.Lack of clarity therefore put all plans on hold otherwise your actions may not bear a positive outcome.
2.Actions which have been negative, ill thought out and now there are consequences.We have not been acting to our highest standards. The need to go and assess whats distracting us from being the best we can be.
3.Our work and daily life are not fulfilling us because we are not demonstrating our highest potential and so we feel restless and uninspired. We need to create space to reconnect with what we really want out of life that will make us feel useful and fulfilled.
4.Not being honest in our friendships our our heart may be closed (lotus blossoms pointing downwards)
(xii) Three of Wands in a Celtic Cross Spread
Card 1: (Heart of Your Situation) – connecting with what inspires you and makes you feel valued.
Card 2: (Obstacles/Challenges) – work & daily life are not fulfilling. We may have made poor choices in the past. Make a list of your virtues and see how they may best be used.
Card 3: (Subconscious Influences) – that feeling that your life could be so much more rewarding if you could find the right vocation. Perhaps you have always wanted to work for yourself, start your own buisness for example.
Card 4: (Your Recent Past) – charity work, helping others
Card 5: (Your Hopes & Goals) – to spend more of your time doing things that truely inspire you and bring the best out of you.
Card 6: (Your Immediate Future) – a career opportunity that will bring the best out of you is just around the corner.
Card 7: (Your Internal Self at this Time) – feeling inspired in what you are doing, open heartedness and contentment.
Card 8: (Your External Environment) – being a good listener, empathy towards others, giving sound advise
Card 9: (Guidance and Warning) – if you dont connect with what truely inspires you, you will continue to feel unfulfilled in your life and or career.
Card 10: (Your Overall Outcome) – work that you find motivated to do in that it expresses your best talents and is supportive to others in the process.

Four of Wands Thoth Tarot Card Tutorial
(i) Four of Wands YouTube Video
My new YouTube channel is : Thoth Tarot Videos. Clicking on the image below will take you to the video on YouTube
(ii) Thoth Tarot Four of Wands
Four wands can be seen in a circle rather like a mandala. The wands form an 8 spoked red wheel on a green background and 8 flames can be seen issuing between the spokes although they are not as strong as in the three of the suit.
Crowley states that the initial will from the two of Wands is complete, in other words we have finished a project, succeeded in a goal but that:
“this limitation bears in itself the seeds of disorder” (Book of Thoth, p191)
(iii) Rider Waite Four of Wands
A celebration is taking place outside a castle (stability). A joyous card indicating harmony, fulfillment, success and possibly a good time to get together with friends and family.
(iv)  Numerology and the Four of Wands
Ace= Monad
Two= Diad
Three = Triad
Four = Tetrad (from which we get the tetrahedron):
Philosophers of Greece stated that reality was comprised of 4 elements: Fire, Water , Air, Earth and so it was a number of the manifestation of our world. We have a sense of completion from the combination of the 4 elements.
1+2+3+4 = 10. Pythagoreans believed the number ten to be the ‘perfect number’ and forms the ‘Tetractys’ as shown below:
(v) Four of Wands, the Tree of Life & 4 Worlds
(a) The Tree of Life
The Four of Wands is associated with the forth sephira ‘Chesed’ ruled by Jupiter.
Chesed is the first sephiroth of the Ethical Triangle on the Tree of Life and also the first sephiroth below the abyss, in a simplified sense, separating the spiritual and material worlds and is the sphere where manifestation of form first appears.
It is the CHANNEL for energy coming through from the Supernal Triangle to flow through the remaining sephira and it gives structure and a sense of completion.
Images associated with Chesed include the Enthroned King,the square and the pyramid, all suggestion a stability.
(b) The 4 Worlds
The Four of Wands is resides in Chesed in Atziluth.
(vi) Astrology of the Four of Wands
Decan : 3rd decan of Aries ruled by Venus (21 – 30°)
Venus in Aries
Venus travels 180° from its natural rulership in Libra to get to Aries so it should be in DETRIMENT here however it is not. It gives some harmony and peace to the aggressiveness of Mars so there are some ‘harmony in opposites’ here in the 4.
Put together we have the emotional desire (Venus) to move in new directions (Aries) but the card reminds us we have work to complete first.
Crowley states in the Book of Thoth (p.190),Venus in Aries implies that “one cannot establish one’s work without tact and gentleness.”
(vii) Symbolism of the Four of Wands
Circle with 8 spokes = completion/harmony similar to a mandala:
8 spokes = the number 8 has Hebrew letters which mean ‘to will’ , ‘to love, ‘to bind’
Wands with Rams Heads = ‘will’ of Aries
Wands with Doves = harmony and peace of Venus
Circle = work has been completed
Green Background = Venus
Yellow Circle = creative sun energy or our energy used up in this task
(viii) Three of Wands to Four of Wands Transition
Completion of the work carried out in the Three of Wands to ones satisfaction. This might relate to the finishing of a work or other project started some time ago.
(ix) Shemhamphorasch Angels of the Four of Wands
Nanael: Facilitates communication with the divine. Inspires meditation and divine communication. Mysticism.
Nithael: Hospitality, eternal youth, celebrity and prestige. Stability, legitimate successor. Artistic and aesthetic talents.
(x) Divinatory Meanings of the Four of Wands
Four of Wands Upright
You have completed a significant phase of a project and can feel very pleased of what you have accomplished so far. A time of joy and satisfaction in life and represents the personal gratification of a job well done or a goal attained. Try to be flexible for the future as we always outgrow structures as they are by definition, limited.
The completion of a property deal, buisness, marriage or family, or patterns of your daily life. These have all been built on solid foundations.
Rest is needed after a period of hard work has come to a successful conclusion
Indicating a need for security (stability of the number 4), and wholeness (the circle).
Completion of a phase in ones life perhaps academically, spiritually or in ones career.
We accomplish things more easily when there is a stability and harmony in our lives. Crowley states tact (sensitivity in dealing with others) and gentleness are necessary in this process
Four of Wands Reversed
The expansiveness of Jupiter in Chesed takes over and perhaps we have taken on more than we can handle in a project and we are beginning to feel stressed about its completion.
A tendency to start new things without completing others.
Too comfortable in the structures of life that we have built. We become complacent. Desires can aso change and therefore we may need to come out of our comfort zone to explore new horizons.
Not feeling whole and balanced within ourselves.
A lack of tact and too much harshness by ourselves or another causing delays in finishing a project or not getting the best out of people. A situation lacking in harmony.
(xii) Four of Wands and The Celtic Cross Spread
Card 1: (Heart of Your Situation) – The desire to complete something which you have started, to have fun and harmony in your life.
Card 2: (Obstacles/Challenges) – We have taken on more than can now handle. Feeling overwhelmed (e.g. a job is proving too time consuming to complete what has been asked of us, to the detriment of our health.
Card 3: (Subconscious Influences) – Feeling insecure and incomplete in your life. (career, personal)
Card 4: (Your Recent Past) – successful completion of a phase in your life. You can always draw on this strength if times are now challenging.
Card 5: (Your Hopes & Goals) – You have something close to your heart that you would like to finish. It may be career, relationship (feeling secure, stable) or spiritually orientated.
Card 6: (Your Immediate Future) – finish current projects before setting new ones for yourself.
Card 7: (Your Internal Self at this Time) – stable, harmoneous, joy ( for example someone completes their A Levels and is going on to University).
Card 8: (Your External Environment) – a tactless work collegue or boss is providing a difficult environment for you to get on and complete your work.
Card 9: (Guidance and Warning) – Once you finish your goals, dont get lazy and rest in your new found security for too long otherwise complacency will creep in.
Crowley states that the initial will from the two of Wands is complete, in other words we have finished a project, succeeded in a goal but that:
“this limitation bears in itself the seeds of disorder” (Book of Thoth, p191)
Card 10: (Your Overall Outcome) – great times ahead indicating the successful completion of your goals, providing you with much joy and stability ( for example: getting your ideal job, house move, relationship)
(xi) Useful Crystals Associated with the Four of Wands
1. Tigers Eye
Tigers Eye Stone is a crystal with lovely bands of yellow-golden colour through it. This is a powerful stone that aids harmony and balance, and helps you to release fear and anxiety.
It stimulates taking action, and helps you to make decisions with discernment and understanding, and unclouded by your emotions.
This is a stone that helps us to be more active, mentally as well as physically… and its major work is within the lower chakras and so has a grounding effect.
2. Haematite
Hematite Crystals have an excellent grounding and balancing energy… as well as being a powerful aid to stimulate the mind. They enhance memory and evoke deep thought. They can be made into jewelry as seen in the picture above.
They will assist the development of logical thought processes, and help you to reach the highest capacity possible. They will heighten self-confidence, will power and self-esteem. The energy of these stones have a strong physical grounding energy, that vibrates strongly at the base or root chakra.
(xii) Affirmations and the Four of Wands
Completing the old releases me for the new

Prince of Disks Thoth Tarot Card Tutorial
Prince of Disks Thoth Tarot Card Tutorial
My new YouTube channel is : Thoth Tarot Videos. The Court Card videos are yet to be remade.
(ii) Thoth Prince of Disks
The prince of Disks is seen sitting in a metal chariot carrying a sceptre crowned with an orb, in the right hand and a globe in the left. The chariot is being pulled by a determined looking bull.
(iii) Prince of Disks:Sub Elements
The sub elements of the Prince of Disks are air and earth. According to elemental dignity rules air and earth are enemies and WEAKEN each other so we would expect some inherent conflict within his make up based on this.
(iv) Tetragrammaton and the Prince of  Disks
The Princes represent the Vau part of the tetragrammaton and are the product of the union of Yodh and He Primal or the Knight and Queen respectively. They are therefore shown to be a hybrid of the two, having both the stability of the Queen through the fixed chariot, and the activity and movement of the knight through the forces moving the chariot. His actions are therefore more enduring than the Knight but less so than the Queen.
(v) Prince of Disks & The Tree of Life
The Princes are found in the sixth sephiroth, Tiphareth in the middle of the Tree of Life which represents harmony and balance after we have had the experiences of the opposite forces of the Pillar of Severity and the Pillar of Mercy. Tiphareth is Kether but on a lower vibration and Yesod but on a higher vibration. It is the child emanating from Kether above, but from the lower planes it is like the ruler of the skies. This sephiroth is also associated with ‘beauty’. The Prince of Disks is found in the sixth sephiroth(Tiphareth) in the fourth world of Assiah.
(vi) Astrology of the Prince of Disks
The Prince of Disks rules from 21 degrees Aries to 20 degrees Taurus and rules three minor arcana cards; 4 of Wands, 5 of Disks & 6 of Disks.
(vii) Prince of Disks Symbolism
Winged Bulls Head Crest = Taurus, the kerubic attribution of this card. Taurus is responsible for his material, earthy down to earth and practical attributes.
Black Chariot = the colour of Earth and Malkuth, the tenth sephira.
Large Orb in left hand = symbol of the Sun and its role in agriculture.He holds it as if to show he has dominion over this process. Crowley says that the globe contains geometrical symbols ( a cross, a cube and 3 circles) representing the planning process of his work in agriculture.
Orbed sceptre in left hand = surmounted by a cross. This is a symbol of the Great Work (Book of Thoth p.167), which is the ascent of the soul to God. The connection here is that food and diet are important in feeding the body which houses the soul, so all are connected.
Meditative pose = contemplative nature of the Prince of Disks. Goes hand in hand with the planning implied by the geometries in the globe in the left hand.
Background Tapestry =  consists of flowers and fruits (indicating abundance). Also present are globules of Nitrogen (according to Snuffin, p.103), with these two representing Earth and Air respectively, the two elements that make up the Prince of Cups
(viii) Minor Arcana Cards Ruled by Prince of Disks
The three minor arcana cards ruled by the Prince of Disks are; 4 of Wands, 5 of Disks & 6 of Disks.
(i) Five of Disks (Worry)
Gives the Prince an overall anxiety about achieving material ambitions and whether he can meet them. It may be perceived rather than actual. Does not really trust in the process of life but tries to control it too much through his actions in the world. Can also indicate anxiety about home environment. We need to calm down a miss directed Mars energy.
(iii) Six of Disks (Success)
This describes the Prince of Disks at his most productive. He uses his energy resources to apply to practical things in the world bringing material reward for his efforts. He has forged ahead like the bull to achieve his ambitions. Financial and material  matters are often positive for him.
(iii) Four of Wands (Completion)
Denotes the completion of a project or work situation. This implies what happens when he follows his plans through to their natural end. There is a sense of completion and fulfilment in his work. As this is his shadow aspect he must guard against complacency and keep his focus on the goal, but nevertheless, it’s a positive attribute.
(ix) I Ching & The Prince of Disks
The Prince of Disks is associated with the 53rd Hexagram called CHIEN and this means ‘DEVELOPING’. Its I Ching forms can be seen in the pictures below showing the hexagram and its associated trigrams.
This Hexagram relates to events which are gradual and unfolding, a deliberate slow cultivation of a situation being the path to success rather than anything revolutionary. You need to develop calmness and persistence as well as being able to adapt to get what you want.
In love refrain from rushing into things and lean towards the romantic cultivation of love  over time.
Generally try to set a good example for others with traditional values, practising inner calm and a sense of duty.

Queen of Wands Thoth Tarot Card Tutorial
Queen of Wands Thoth Tarot Card Tutorial
My new YouTube channel is : Thoth Tarot Videos. The Court Card videos are yet to be remade.
(ii) Thoth Queen Of Wands
Here we see a Queen of Wands seated upon a throne with a leopard sitting at her right side. She has her right hand on the leopards head and in her left hand she holds a rod with a pine cone at the tip.
(iii) Rider Waite Queen of Wands
(iv) Sub Elements of the Queen of Wands
She is made up of the fiery aspect of Water
Fire and Water are enemies, they weaken each other therefore she will have contradictions in her nature which are hard to resolve like the Knight of Cups. This is despite the fact that she is a very strong person but this inherent imbalance of her make up means that she is apt to cross between her light and dark sides often.
(v) Tetragrammaton & the Queen of Wands
She represents He Primal
(vi) Queen of Wands & the Tree of Life
The Queens are related to the third sephiroth or Binah on the tree of life. Whereas the Knights act under the influence of Chockmah, the Queens have the capacity to internalize and self reflect more. This requires a quality of endurance that the Knights do not possess.
In tarot Binah is associated with the  Three and the Queens. the Threes  are associated with manifestation in matter, and the Queens are the Mothers of the elements of their suits, much like Binah has been called the great mother giving birth to form.
Binah represents the female potency of Chokmah, just as Chockmah represents the male potency. Binah is the great sea or womb which receives the force of Chohmah and begins to give it form. It heads the pillar of severity since in form comes birth and death, and so we have limits being formed here. Binah is ruled by Saturn which governs time. and in his Greek form Kronos ate his children. So Binah as well as the positive attribute of giving birth to ‘form’ in creation ,also is responsible for the cycle of birth and death, hence a suitable place is the head of the pillar of severity.
(vii) Astrology of the Queen of Wands
She rules 21°Pisces to 20° Aries. This bestows the spirituality and sensitivity of Pisces with the strong will and ambition of Aries. As we will see, this combination does not always produce positive results !
Pisces gives her sensitivity and inspiration
Aries gives her leadership and self-confidence.
(viii) Symbology of the Queen of Wands
Crown = has 12 rays of light emanating from it representing the 12 signs of the zodiac. It is also open and expressive & is connected to spirit.
The zodiac is a representation of NUIT the Sky Goddess as seen in the Aeon card:
The above implies integration of her personality and connection with her different traits. Also suggests she has worked through issues to be able to have a clear vision (zodiac is her crown, so a crown of knowledge of what the different signs bring to the world). Therefore relates well to others. Ties in with her compassionate side.
Throne = of fire. Her passion, ambition and energy to get things done and assert herself. Sometimes this translates to imposing her will on others.
Crowley states : “She is seated upon a throne of flame, ordered into geometrical light by her material power. Beneath the throne the surging flames are steady.”
Steady flames = she has gained an element of self-mastery and control of herself
Fish clasp for her cloak =  compassion, spirituality, sensitivity. Associated with Pisces
Thyrsus = wand with pine cone has several associations.  The thyrsus, associated with Dionysus (or Bacchus) is a symbol of prosperity, fertility, hedonism, and pleasure/enjoyment  penis and the pine cone representing the “seed” issuing forth.
Paul Hughes Barlow reminds us that Bacchus also relates to The Fool. He is also intoxicated with life but has not met life’s challenges yet so there is more of an innocence to his nature.
Queens eyes closed = reminds us of this ‘intoxication’ and absorption she has with her life as she is fully committed to accomplishing her goals.
(ix) Mythology of the Queen of Wands
She represents a woman who, before she knew who she was, had black hair and walked with a panther by her side. She began to discover her nature through self-development, her hair turned brown and her panther turned into a leopard. When she fully realised who she was and expressed herself fully in the world, her hair turned red.. The spots of the leopard remained as a reminder of the dark times she had experienced in her past.
So the Queen of Wands represents the process of self discovery and awakening to who we really are, even though this means we have to experience possible dark periods in our life.
(x) Minor Arcana Cards ruled by the Queen of Wands
She Rules : 10 of Cups (Satiety) + 2 of Wands (Dominion) + 3 of Wands (Virtue)
10 of Cups (Satiety)
This is the opposite of what she normally expresses as a goal orientated hard-working person. In this shadow aspect of herself can lurk a tendency to rest upon her achievements and riches to the point of not making best use of them. The cups do not overflow and pass on the ‘riches’. She can be greedy and selfish and not share her insights and give to others.
2 of Wands (Dominion)
This is an important aspect of her nature and represents her desire and confidence to go out into the world and fulfill her goals and establish herself. From this she derives the energy to complete tasks and get things done. She has an authority and a presence that people respect and has lots of innovation through Mars in Aries to make her a great success in what she chooses to apply herself to.
3 of Wands (Virtue)
With Virtue, we have the direction in which the two of wands needs to be applied in order for her to be the best she can be and be of service to the world.Open lotus blossoms mean following what has meaning for us and following something from the heart. We have an understanding of what are our ‘virtues’ .. what we have to offer to the world in a useful way and so we are in tune with our own needs at the same time. This card is also about trusting ourselves to make the right decisions in our life and not be held back by fear. Angel Paths says : “Virtue is about excellence – ethically and personally. It is about developing and maintaining high standards of behaviour, and then learning to have the confidence, self belief and strength of character to live out those standards through our every act.”
(xi) I Ching & the Queen of Wands
Crowley associated the Queen of Wands with the 17 th Hexagram, Sui
Crowley states :
“It indicates reflection upon impulse, and the consequently even flow of action.”
This hexagram has been called ADAPTING. Nature adapts in the seasons, animals fu thickens in the winter as does the bark of trees. Applying to the Queen of Wands, it means knowing when to act, when not to. When to speak and when to stay silent. Success through adapting to the realities around you and being flexible in thought and deed. She can have a tendency to control and dominate and so this adapting quality is important for her to get on in the world.
As was indicated by her sub elements, she does have contradictions and so she must strive to be the best she can be.
True power comes in serving others, not dominating so she must strive not to control events (despite her Arian nature to dominate)
(xii) Divinatory Meanings of the Queen of Wands
Queen of Wands Upright
Someone going through the process of self discovery and remembering how powerful they are. reclaiming their life.
Has got to this point by resolving difficult issues in the past. She now a very strong character.
A time to express your natural power and beauty and move on from the past.
A strong independent leader focussed on her goals and knows what she wants. She leads a very active life. She has a lot of creative energy and creates a powerful first impression.
Queen of Wands Reversed
Can be quick-tempered, tyrannical, pursue her goals until she is burnt out, domineering, jealousy.
(xiii) Celtic Cross Interpretation of the Queen of Wands
1: Heart of the Situation = The need to put difficult times behind you, reclaim your personal power and be one pointed in the pursuit of your goals
2: Possible obstacle = issues of the  past holding you back, disconnecting you from your confidence in the present.
3: Unconscious Desires = to be more confident and know what we want out of life not letting the past hold us back
4: Recent Past = confident, goal setting, independent, a leader.
5: Hopes and goals = to be more confident and know what we want out of life not letting the past hold us back
6: Short Term Future = creative , know our direction in life
7: Our Self Image = confidence, independence, determination
8: Environment = An over dominant person in your life
9: Guidance & Warning = is our need for goals and independence limiting our balance in life. Are we being too controlling of others ?
10: Overall Outcome = reclaim our personal power and confidence. Know our direction and move forward.

## Textos de Crowley - Livros Originais

### Emperor

## Book of Thoth

BOOK OF THOTH PART2A
emblem. There is here no contradiction; such opposition as there seems to be 
is only the opposition necessary to balance. And this is shown by the revolving moons.
The heraldry of the Empress is two-fold: on the one side, the Pelican of tradition feeding its young from the blood of its own heart; on the other, the White Eagle of the Alchemist.
With regard to the Pelican, its full symbolism is only available to Initiates of the Fifth degree of the O.T.O. In general terms, the meaning may be suggested by identifying the Pelican herself with the Great Mother and her offspring, with 
the Daughter in the formula of Tetragrammaton. It is because the daughter is 
the daughter of her mother that she can be raised to her throne. In other language, there is a continuity of life, an inheritance of blood, which binds all forms of Nature together. There is no break between light and dark ness. 
Natura non facit saltum. If these considerations were fully understood, it 
would become possible to reconcile the Quantum theory with the Electro-maguetic equations.
The White Eagle in this trump corresponds to the Red Eagle
in the Consort card, the Emperor. It is here necessary to work back wards. For in these highest cards are the symbols of perfection; both the initial perfection of Nature and the final perfection of Art; not only Isis, but Nephthys. Consequently, the details of the work pertain to subsequent cards, especially Atu vi and Atu xiv.
At the back of the card is the Arch or Door, which is the inter pretation of the letter Daleth. This card, summed up, may be called the Gate of Heaven. But, because of the beauty of the symbol, because of its omniform presentation, the student who is dazzled by any given manifestation may be led astray. In no other card is it so necessary to disregard the parts, to concentrate upon the whole.
IV. THE EMPEROR
This card is attributed to the letter Tzaddi, and it refers to the sign of Aries in the Zodiac. This sign is ruled by Mars, and therein the Sun is exalted. The sign is thus a combination of energy in its most material form with the idea of authority. The sign TZ or TS implies this in the original, onomatopoetic form of language. It is derived from Sanskrit roots meaning Head and Age, and is found to-day in words like Cæsar, Tsar, Sirdar, Senate, Senior, Signor, Sefior, Seigneur.
file:///D:/Books/Non-Fiction/Magick+Esoteric/Crowley/The book of Thoth/thoth2a.htm (23 of 63)28.02.2004 22:48:43BOOK OF THOTH PART2A
The card represents a crowned male figure, with imperial vestments and 
regalia. He is seated upon the throne whose capitals are the heads of the Himalayan wild ram, since Aries means a Ram. At his feet, couchant, is the Lamb and Flag, to cdnfirm this attribution on the lower plane; for the ram, by nature, is a wild and courageous animal, lonely in lonely places, whereas when tamed and made to lie down in green pastures, nothing is left but the docile, cowardly, gregarious and succulent beast. This is the theory of government.
The Emperor is also one of the more important alchemical cards; with Atu II and III, he makes up the triad: Sulphur, Mercury, Salt. His arms and head form an upright triangle; below, crossed legs represent the Cross. This figure is the aichemical symbol of Sulphur (see Atu X). Sulphur is the male fiery energy of the Universe, the Rajas of Hindu philosophy. This is the swift creative energy, the initiative of all Being. The power of the Emperor is a general-
p.78
ization of the paternal power; hence such symbols as the Bee and the Fleur-deAys, which are shown on this card. With regard to the quality of this power, it must be noted that it represents sudden, violent, but impermanent activity. If it persists too long, it burns and destroys. Distinguish from the Creative Energy of Aleph and Beth: this card is below the Abyss.
The Emperor bears a sceptre (surmounted by a ram's head for the reasons given above) and an orb surmounted by a Maltese cross, which signifies that his energy has reached a successful issue, that his government has been established.
There is one further symbol of importance. His shield represents the two-headed eagle crowned with a crimson disk. This represents the red tincture of the alchemist, of the nature of gold, as the white eagle shown in Atu III pertains to his consort, the Empress, and is lunar, of silver.
It is finally to be observed that the white light which descends upon him indicates the position of this card in the Tree of Life. His authority is derived from Chokmah, the creative Wisdom, the Word, and is exerted upon Tiphareth, the organized man.
V. THE HIEROPHANT
This card is referred to the letter Vau, which means a Nail; of this instrument nine appear at the top of the card; they serve to fix the oriel behind the main figure of the picture.

1.2        Palavras chaves:
Começo do começo, primeiro passo, VONTADE, novo caminho, façanha, SUTILIDADE, inquietude, SAGACIDADE, lucidez, iluminação, PERSISTÊNCIA.
(-) CÓLERA, turbulência, ROTINA, voluntarismo, VIOLÊNCIA, conflitos, PREGUIÇA, situação sem saída, DEPRESSÃO, vontade reprimida, IRA, preguiça, deprimidos.
1.3         Movimentação Sephiroth: As na primeira posição
Refere-se a “Yod” em Kether, no mundo de Atziluth, de onde provém todas as emanações e expressa uma Vontade incontestável, implacável, absoluta que pode ser utilizada em vias de um ponto determinado. Temos aqui a causa primeira, o movimento que movimenta todos os outros movimentos e cuja fonte é sua própria natureza.
1.4        Arcano – Mundo: As de paus mundo de Atziluth
Recebe o título de Raiz dos poderes do fogo ou ainda Raiz de todas as iniciativas. Refere-se ao elemento Fogo e astrologicamente corresponde ao primeiro decanato de Áries onde manifesta seus fluxos mediante as roupagens deste signo e sob as pulsações do regente deste decanato que é Kether.
Neste ponto, Kether o primeiro ponto de partida na Árvore e no zodíaco, o centro produtor de iniciativas, a essência divina, expressa-se por intermédio de seu próprio centro. No mais, o resultado desta alquimia se exteriorizara ainda pelo tom prismático de Geburah, o coordenador deste subciclo evolutivo.
Trata-se de um elemento iniciador em todas as análises, senão vejamos: O As representa Kether a coroa Sephiroth, aquele que está acima de todas as coisas, o primeiro. O naipe de paus é o elemento inicializador das cartas que seguem a sequência “Yod”, “He”, “Vô”, “He”. Portanto é o “Yod” dos naipes. Refere-se ainda ao primeiro decanato de Áries que também é o primeiro signo do zodíaco vinculado ao elemento fogo e que é o primeiro dos elementos.
Inicia algo que até então não havia enquanto rompe com tudo o anterior. Encontra sua raiz na vontade suprema, do Real Ser, na parte divina que carregamos dentro de nós, ainda que desviemos estas energias para uma manifestação obscura, perversa em razão do estado em que nos encontramos. Afinal, mesmo o mal tem um início.
O As de paus no mundo de Atziluth indica que a vontade está atuando em seu próprio terreno, onde deve ser efetivamente exercida do modo a tornar-se o motor de todas as coisas e, orienta o indivíduo, a seguir a sua própria natureza.
1.5         Virtudes concedidas:
1º.- Dispor de uma poderosa vontade executora e transformadora.
2º.- Ser o primeiro, o protagonista de uma façanha em qualquer domínio, seja político, social, desportivo – vencer algo singularmente difícil.
3º.- Virtude da sutilidade de espírito, sagacidade para descobrir as trapaças, os enganos e uma extraordinária lucidez para consigo mesmo.
4º.- Liberar a nós e aos demais da turbulência e da cólera.
5º.- Obtenção da iluminação divina.
1.6         Descrição Sephiroth:
VEHUIAH é o primeiro 1º da 1º ordem de anjos denominado como Coro dos Serafins, situa-se na morada filosofal de número 1, rege o sendeiro 1, em que Kether resplandece as virtudes de seu próprio centro. Trata das forças de Kether o primeiro ponto de partida na Arvore e no zodíaco, o centro produtor de iniciativas, a essência divina; o “Yod” do Mundo de Atziluth, Fogo do Fogo. Nesta casa nos deparamos com a essência filosofal chamada VONTADE, o conjunto de qualidades, propriedades e atributos que se refere ao impulso primordial, a Vontade primeira, pois é o mensageiro mais próximo daquele que está por cima de todas as coisas. Trata-se de uma força de Vontade constitutiva, a raiz oculta de todas as coisas, por tratar do começo do começo, onde tudo tem seu princípio, de onde sai o primeiro passo, o primeiro movimento. Nada do que existe depois dele existiria se a energia VEHUIAH não houvesse originado anteriormente com sua essência. Na vida humana concede a capacidade de proceder de acordo com os impulsos naturais, o movimento holístico, integrado que inicia deste o centro interno em Unidade com todas as coisas de modo que faculta a criação, empreendimento de novas situações além, inclusive, da normativa já que se trata de um primeiro impulso das emanações, portanto, sem resistência pré determinada. Daí vem o atributo, representado pelo Alfa, Aleph, esta qualidade imbuída de poder denominada Deus elevado e Exaltado por cima de todas as coisas.
Quando tratamos do movimento primordial, da causa primeira, nos recordamos de como Tomas de Aquino pretendeu provar a existência de Deus, como um ente personificado, criador de todo. O fez por intermédio de suas teorias conhecidas como as 5 vias. E neste ponto procurava justificar seu ponto de vista ao buscar o primeiro movimento que deu início a todos os demais movimentos, o primeiro ente gerado que passou a gerar todos os outros. Deixa transparecer um impulso de VEHUIAH em um momento qualquer de sua existência.
Ao tratarmos do tema morada filosofal, nos deparamos com algo que parece um tanto abstrato, que transparece apenas uma teoria acadêmica. Contudo devemos ressaltar que estamos a tratar de energias muito além da compreensão humana, compreensão esta que é capaz apenas de adentrar naquilo do que esteja ligado a percepção dos cinco sentidos. Uma energia tão sutil como a de Kether se fosse baixada sem uma difração para o plano físico certamente o desintegraria em uma fração inominável de segundo. Lembremos que Moises vislumbrava a Deus somente pelas costas.
Assim as energias que vem descendo até chegar ao plano físico vão sendo amortizada de uma forma semelhante que um prisma que divide as cores da luz e que por fim ficam visíveis aos nossos sentidos.
A percepção da fragmentação fica a cargo de uns poucos e a analogia nos permite conhecer as sutilezas que descem ao nosso plano já que as Leis físicas são reflexos das Leis existentes em planos superiores; muito embora a medida em que se aproxime da Força Primeira o número de Leis vão diminuindo na razão inversa a que a liberdade aumenta.
Lembremos ainda o pronunciamento de Hermes “…assim como é embaixo é encima e assim como é encima é embaixo.”, o Kabir Jesus em sua oração disse: “seja feita a tua vontade assim na terra como nos céus”.
Os Gênios, Anjos como queiram chamá-los também são chamados de Deuses internos, e não é por acaso; eis que todos nós temos em nosso interior a contrapartida de tudo o que existe no universo, fomos criados a imagem e semelhança de Deus – ser superior para o religioso e, a natureza, o universo, para o homem de ciência.
Somos anjos e demónios, seja nos planos internos, psicológico, na aglomeração do sangue e na coagulação das energias nos diversos departamentos de nosso cérebro. E mais do que isto, uma das verdades que por milênios tentam esconder de nós é que “somos Deuses” com todas as virtudes, atributos etc., que constantes no Absoluto, carecedores apenas do seu devido desenvolvimento, atividades.
Os Budistas dizem que somos o sonho de Brahma; tal fato tem sua razão de ser, se nos demos conta que somos Deuses adormecidos. Assim agora podemos compreender a saudação hinduísta:
Namastê
“O Deus que habita em mim,
saúda o Deus que habita em ti.
O aforismo grego constante no templo de Delfos nos remete ao mesmo ponto: “Nosce te ipsum”, propagado no Egito antigo, pelos grandes filósofos: “Homem, conhece-te a ti mesmo, assim conhecerá o universo e aos deuses.”
Portanto é bastante sábio lembrarmos antes de fazer o mal ao próximo é bom lembrarmos que dentro dele existe um Deus com todas as características e atributos do absoluto – se somos a imagem e semelhança de Deus é porque isto está dentro de nós. E, o que está dentro de nós forma uma unidade conosco e também com a unidade. Ou um galho de videira não é a videira?
Os 72 anjos nos ajudam a nos encontrar com nosso Deus interno e facilitar nossa vida enquanto fazemos isto.
VEHUIAH tem a missão de estabelecer em nós a morada da energia primordial, de onde emanam todas as outras, o exemplo que todos seguirão, afinal qualquer que seja o Gênio, tipo de energia, para sua utilização primeiramente é necessário que haja vontade.
Sem a Vontade de Constituir não há como pôr a existência a cabo.
Aristóteles tratava ato e potência como modos divergentes e diferentes sendo que a potência referente a algo que tem a capacidade de realizar sua existência, mas que ainda não está materializado e ato diz-se da coisa que concretamente existe, que possui existência, manifesta, real.
A vontade carrega em si potência e ato já que se trata de um atributo exclusivo do Ser, que se encontra no topo do mundo arquétipo. Toda a criação vem de cima para baixo embora tenhamos a ilusão do contrário. A vontade “é”, portanto, é “ato” ainda que não tenha se manifestado nos mundos inferiores e em aparência esteja a nível de potência. E mesmo que no curso de descenso possa se modificar já foi manifesta a nível superior.
Do mesmo modo está presente no homem e na mulher, como força engendrante e engendradora – ato é potência trabalhando juntos a ponto de se confundirem.
Antes de se construir uma casa 1. Tem-se a vontade de construir. 2. Emociona-se com o que se pretende; 3. Faz-se o projeto na mente e depois no papel e 4. Executa-se o projeto.
Sem a Vontade de construir, de constituir, obra alguma pode ser levado a existir, assim esta energia está presente em todas as criações não importa se o agente tenha ou não consciência da força que está manipulando. De outro modo se há consciência na operação então temos a energia que emana do Ser e, se interage com mais força junto ao corpo psíquico o futuro empreendimento e todas as ações ao longo da existência, capaz de atrair circunstâncias propícias.
Disto apreendemos que na vontade estão todas as energias, todos os elementos que descende de forma prismática até a cristalização no mundo físico. Portanto na vontade suprema encontramos unidos ato e potência, porque é daí que vem toda a criação muito embora sua manifestação no mundo físico seja inicialmente em potência e posteriormente em ato a medida que a energia desce pelos planos.
Basta compreender que: se estamos aqui é porque em algum ponto foi dado o start desta energia pois tudo começa pelo primeiro, pelo número “Um”. Se vamos fazer uma caminhada temos que dar o primeiro passo, ao escrevermos um livro ele está na primeira letra e na mão daquele que redigirá mesmo antes que algo seja escrito, então é aí que está a energia de VEHUIAH. VEHUIAH é a porta por onde entram todos os outros Gênios pois alguém tem que ser o primeiro.
Lembro-me que antes de iniciar esta obra os Gênios estavam em euforia querendo que já fosse publicada, contudo nem sequer havíamos lançado a primeira letra de modo que a princípio não compreendemos o que estava ocorrendo. Ocorre que o primeiro movimento vem de cima e nos mundos abaixo tudo vai se cristalizando, plano a plano. Assim, nos mundos superiores já comemoravam a obra pronta e lançada que no mundo físico demorariam anos.
Em um jogo de sinuca VEHUIAH é a bola que encaçapa todas as outras. No efeito dominó é a primeira pedra que derruba as demais e de todos os movimentos das peças também é o primeiro. No Direito é o Princípio primeiro, da Proporcionalidade que rege a balança, no qual estão contidos todos os demais[1].
Dessarte, VEHUIAH é a energia pela qual dispomos da chamada “Vontade”, aquilo que está por cima de todas as coisas, o arranque primordial, o começo do começo. Vemos no primeiro versículo do Genesis que o “Princípio” criou Eloim (coletivo de Eloa – Deus) e tudo o que existe, ou seja, à Vontade primordial criadora precedeu a própria criação.
Por ser a energia primeira é um atributo de Kether, do Pai, e é por VEHUIAH que dispomos da porção do Pai. Quem é rico desta essência está sempre predisposto ao recomeço mesmo que tudo esteja perdido.
Certamente que foi a inspiração de VEHUIAH que levou o autor de “E o vento levou” a fazer Scarlet OHara depois de perder tudo na vida, inclusive seu amor, a dizer a arrepiante frase: “Tara, meu lar. Irei para o meu lar e pensarei numa forma de tê-lo de volta! Afinal, amanhã é um novo dia!”
Quando o mundo pareça desabar e tudo pareça perdido, enredado, convém buscarmos auxílio a VEHUIAH, nos dias, horas, nos momentos de invocação situados no cabeçalho desde subtítulo. Peçamos que estabeleça em nós a morada desta energia, que preencha nossos interiores, nossos espaços internos vazios e carentes desta força, que este vácuo seja preenchido pois, assim, encontraremos a vontade necessária para enfrentar todos os percalços da vida, novos caminhos se abrirão, um novo passo terá início. Esotericamente se sabe que a melhor maneira de enfrentar um problema é iniciando algo novo. Daí surge uma nova vida, uma nova chance.
Quando muitas situações estão ruins, o mundo pesa sobre os ombros ou cai sob nossa cabeça podemos evocar o Restart Ketheriano. Trata-se de um recomeço, ou um início que realoca tudo que esteja em movimento, promove um novo impulso e permitem atuar mesmo quando o karma está em andamento. Isto porque Kether se encontra no mundo das emanações, em um ponto anterior a Binah que marca o compasso das Leis de Causa e Efeito. Não se trata de uma redenção, mas de uma movimentação comandada por uma força que antecede a Binah e que, portanto, não está sujeito a mesma. Isto nos dá um fôlego, concede um modo diferente de atuar no intuito de superar a situação. Então este Restart pode ser um filho que nasce, início de um trabalho, enfim.
É interessante notar que em todos os meios expostos a vontade é o elemento fundamental e, portanto, VEHUIAH estará presente. Assim, deve-se solicitar ao Gênio o material anímico necessário para realizar o empreendimento desejado.
Para se ter à vontade inicialmente devemos saber com clareza o que queremos. Vontade pura, detalhada, exata, sem conflitos.
O conflito interno é um destruidor, um exterminador da vontade, mas, com a ajuda de VEHUIAH pode ser sanado.
Aqui surge uma questão bastante incomoda e por vezes até assustadora:
Quando não estamos certos do que queremos e pedimos luz, as Jerarquias ou alguma Lei de afinidade vibratória nos lançam trevas. O que pode parecer ruim, na realidade é algo incompreendido. Basta ver que quando a luz é pouca não é quase notada no mundo cotidiano, contudo, quando as trevas são espessas a luz mais tênue, o fogo fátuo se ilumina como um sol, um enorme clarão. Assim, são lançadas trevas espessas para que possa ser vislumbrada a luz oculta que se encontra entre nosso subconsciente. Esta luz que é nossa própria essência, é um raio de nosso Real Ser, a energia da vontade.
Devemos aqui saber diferenciar Real Ser do ego, personalidade, eu superior, eu inferior etc. O Real Ser refere-se a nossa verdadeira e única identidade, ligada a Kether, a chispa divina que nos dá a identidade de Deus.
Tomas de Aquino dizia: Sou forte naquele que me fortalece. Referindo-se a passagem constante no novo testamento:
“Filipenses 4:13 Todas as coisas posso naquele que me fortalece. ”
Podemos parafraseá-lo e dizer “Somos Deuses em Deus”.
No último dia da criação, disse Deus:
“Façamos o homem à nossa imagem, conforme a nossa semelhança” (Gênesis 1:26).
1.7        Das virtudes concedidas:
1.7.1    Dispor de uma poderosa vontade executora e transformadora.
A Vontade é a origem do fogo abrasador que levamos em nosso interior. É o fogo que anima a criação. Onde há a criação, o “Um”, o primeiro, não pode haver rotina. As pessoas com muita energia de VEHUIAH dificilmente conseguem trabalhar em tarefas rotineiras, são indivíduos inquietos que se contrariada sua natureza pode acarretar problemas já que porão nervosos os que o rodeiam.
Ao pedir Vontade estamos desejando que haja movimento em nossa existência, que as energias circulem expulsando o velho para a fundação do novo. Impele o que está parado a entrar em movimento.
A Vontade nos leva a ocuparmos a posição de Altos Cargos e consequentemente a glória, celebridade, afetos, abundância. Embora seja ambicionada por uns já não o são por aqueles que estão no topo da sociedade, que nada lhes falta, o que ocasiona um enfraquecimento da vontade. Este fato por si só faz com que muitas almas, embora com méritos para uma situação mais confortável neste mundo, resolvam vir a em posição menos favorável, contudo mais estimulante, que provoque à vontade.
O derrame da essência da primeira casa não se faz automaticamente, mas é o resultado de um processo interno, geralmente inconsciente, e muitas vezes oriunda de uma relação de causa e efeito. Contudo esta energia pode ser dirigida conscientemente para as experiências que desejamos viver.
Temos como objetivo adquirir experiência. Então o Real Ser envia uma parte de Si para os planos inferiores, outros mundos onde não poderia estar sem um veículo adequado – sob pena de destruição do local. Há a concessão do livre arbítrio para a realização dos trabalhos. É um fenômeno comum que a parte que anda pelos mundos inferiores se desligue de seu Ser Interno e não consiga mais ouvir a sua voz. Faz-se então necessário o “religare”. Ocorre que antes era “Um” com o Real Ser e consequentemente com a Unidade, agora houve uma separação. Com o desligamento ocorrem as experiências desagradáveis, isto porque antes havia a “Vontade” que é um elemento ativo, mas com o desligamento vem então os “desejos” que são passivos.
Cabe lembrar que a vontade requer uma concentração de energia, portanto deve ser ativa. Os desejos por serem passivos enfraquecem à vontade. Por requerer uma concentração de energia, a Vontade, não pode ser diluída, assim, muitos desejos dissolvem a energia e enfraquece a Vontade. É necessário saber o que se quer mais e não dividir à vontade em muitos desejos. Os cabalistas afirmam que não podemos estar em mais de uma experiência de cada vez, assim como não se pode servir a dois senhores ao mesmo tempo.
O indivíduo que possua em seu horóscopo o canal aberto para esta energia será capaz de colocar em movimento qualquer assunto que queira e, como Scarlet OHara, recomeçar do zero se for preciso. Destarte, quando nos encontremos em uma situação sem saída, perdido o rumo, desfalecidos podemos pedir a ajuda a VEHUIAH o que equivale a dizer: Se a mesa posta não lhe agrada, vire a mesa.
Querer é primeiro dos quatro elementos que compõe o mistério da esfinge:
Querer (Leão) pertence ao mundo de Atziluth, arquétipo, de emanação, ligado a Kether de onde provém a Vontade;
Saber (Homem) pertence ao mundo de Briah, que se encarregará de dar amor-sabedoria a energia trabalhada, por estar relacionado a Hochmah e onde estão presentes as aguas sentimentais, a energia, matéria que dinamizará à vontade
Ousar (Águia) pertence ao mundo de Yetzirah, de formação, ligadas a Binah e onde começa a exteriorizar-se, manifestar-se a Vontade emanada de cima.
Calar (Touro) pertence ao mundo de Assiah, devemos nos calar no mundo físico para que as energias se cristalizem em atos, fatos – calar aqui significa agir no plano de Malkuth.
Se ocorrer que a pessoa não tenha este Gênio em sua carta natal, poderá obter ajuda de alguém que o tenha. Esta pessoa, geralmente em sua manifestação regularmente demonstrará muita energia de Vontade, iniciativa.
Cumpre esclarecer aqui que cada pessoa tem pelo menos 8 gênios, provavelmente muito mais, em sua carta natal, se considerarmos as casas e aspectos dos planetas e este fato é um sinal que possui acesso a estas energias com mais facilidade do que quem não as têm em razão de sua evolução e trabalhos feitos em outras existências      .
O que é dito aqui trata-se de um princípio que rege todos os demais gênios.
1.7.2    Ser o primeiro, o protagonista de uma façanha em qualquer domínio, seja político, social, desportivo – como vencer algo singularmente difícil.
Como esta força sempre promove uma atividade desafiadora. Os indivíduos ligados a esta dinâmica estarão sempre fazendo alguma coisa. Esquecera o já realizado, seja bom ou ruim, e partirá sempre para novos horizontes, vencendo barreiras, já que não lhe é facultado ter ataduras.
A Vontade torna incômoda a vida dos que a rodeiam, pois, saca do marasmo, da zona de conforto para lançá-los diretamente no campo de batalha. Assim, quem leva uma vida social bem situada sentira profundo incomodo, já que coloca o inerte em movimento.
Atua intrínseca e extrinsecamente de forma que o impulso interno em qualquer indivíduo, situação, começa desde dentro como um incomodo que lança para a atividade.
Sendo uma força de movimento fará com que os deprimidos mudem seu curso.
Ao acordarmos em seu horário, e nesse momento invocarmos suas energias teremos um dia com mais vigor e produtivo, daí vem a frase: Deus ajuda quem madruga.
1.7.3    Virtude da sutilidade de espírito, sagacidade para descobrir as trapaças, os enganos e uma extraordinária lucidez para consigo mesmo.
A utilização da força 1 nos aporta sutilidade, sagacidade, no sentido de proceder cientificamente de acordo com o conhecimento dos ritmos naturais. Uma ciência que se encontra escondido nos recônditos interiores do ser humano e que se expressa com arte. Para estarmos aqui, necessitamos de regras para a convivência harmônica e estarmos de acordo com todos os planos.
VEHUIAH, estando acima de Binah, o criador de regras, não permite que se encerre unicamente em uma normativa cega, ao pé da letra, mas sendo o dinamizador, cria situações novas que permite que as regras evoluam e até se revoguem as anteriores. E daí que induz ao homem que proceda com ciência, mas também com arte.
Enquanto escrevíamos estas linhas, esta subparte da obra, passávamos pela fase “Vô” de VEHUIAH em sua situação por domicílio e concomitantemente por SITAEL em sua casa por rotação e que trabalha como um construtor de Leis.
Momento em que foi aprovado a Lei que autoriza a utilização da fosfoetanolamina sintética em que milhares de pessoas com câncer tem afirmado que ajuda no controle da doença, mas que a ANVISA – órgão de controle dos medicamentos-, por algum motivo, seja científico ou a pedido da indústria farmacêutica, tem proibido. Oras, ainda que não ajudasse basta lembramos como nossa psique é capaz modificar a matéria pelas vias da fé, já sabemos que pela física quântica se deduz que o agente é capaz de alterar os resultados, quanto mais se for coletiva. Então por um fato, por vezes, além de nossa compreensão, a Lei torna-se caduca, obsoleta, um entrave e VEHUIAH providencia um assim start no sistema.
Lembremos do brocardo que diz: “A lei é feita para o homem e não o homem para a lei. “
1.7.4    Liberar a nós e aos demais da turbulência e da cólera.
A Vontade sem controle pode levar as paixões, zelos, orgulho, enfermidades. A ira está diretamente relacionada a contrariedade da Vontade.
Já se sabe que na natureza nada se perde, tudo se transforma conforme pregou Lavoisier, em parte. Sendo a Vontade uma energia, esta deverá ser direcionada para algum lugar. Entende-se que se ela não for utilizada converter-se á em cólera e turbulência. Daí temos que os jovens, cheios de energia, devem se dedicar aos estudos, ao esporte, ao trabalho para não serem direcionados aos delitos.
1.7.5    Obtenção da iluminação divina.
O lado negativo da força
Do mesmo modo que em cima, VEHUIAH em seu aspecto negativo, nos impulsionara por meio de uma Vontade poderosa, uma ânsia que não conseguimos resistir, que temos que executar, eis que se trata da mesma energia citada, mas agora em seu aspecto negativo, abismal, que abita o submundo de nossa consciência. Recôncavos que tememos confrontar. Sua representação interna pode vir acompanhada do guardião do umbral que um dia teremos que enfrentar e vencê-lo. Se não o vencermos em nosso mundo interior tenderá a cristalizar-se no exterior em uma dinâmica tão complicada como a energia desperdiçada para os reinos inferiores. Conheceremos então o inferno na terra e se ainda assim a força negativa permanecer em nossa psique o enfrentaremos nos planos negativos da 5º dimensão inferior que é o lugar onde se encontra nossa psique atualmente por carência de trabalhos internos. Podemos entender agora a origem da palavra inferno, inferius, pois somos os construtores de nossa psique, de nosso interior e consequentemente de nosso exterior já que em regra o exterior é o reflexo de nosso interior, a exceção fica por conta de estarmos em um mundo coletivo onde sempre haverá pessoas conhecidas de muito tempo e novos contatos. Ainda assim fazemos nossa história com os novos protagonistas.
Então precisamos enfrentar nossos guardiões do umbral, que vedam nossa passagem para planos mais elevados, e evacuar as energias indesejáveis. O lado abismal de VEHUIAH produzem turbulência, cólera em razão de desejos não realizados, da energia sufocada pela timidez, pela covardia, pela opressão não vencida, a voz interior não atendida.
Nossa morada atual, a morada física terrestre é onde as forças abismais têm muita força e manifestam-se mais prontamente. Se existe o gênio positivo de VEHUIAH é certo que devem existir sua contrapartida que de sua origem abismal promovem que, suas energias, emerjam em nosso mundo por meio de um fato, situação material, ardil tramado que de pronto encontram justificativas aos olhos dos interessados originando o furor. Contudo as forças abismais carregam em si, selo da precariedade. Assim o é por subverterem a ordem que emana de onde tudo foi criado, levando todo o projeto a ruína já que só conseguem vencer quando não encontram a resistência de uma força que a sujeite novamente a Ordem.
Ocorrerão turbulências, voluntarismos tenebrosos, dificuldades, pisar nos demais, situações difíceis, começos em momentos ruins, violência, conflitos, ruinas etc. em razão de uma imperiosa necessidade de exteriorizar à Vontade ora reprimida, incapaz de formular, de canalizar de uma maneira ordenada.
Nos momentos de VEHUIAH do abismo, onde haja maus aspectos – quadraturas por exemplo, deve-se tomar cuidado ao iniciar as coisas para que não absorvam em sua dinâmica este estado de energia.
A boa notícia é que tomar consciência da cólera e sua dinâmica equivale a dissolver a energia inferior. E neste momento que com a ajuda de VEHUIAH obtemos a iluminação.
Se VEHUIAH promove o movimento, a atividade, a sua contraparte estará marcado ainda pela inatividade, pela falta de iniciativa, preguiça, a acomodação no enfrentamento das dificuldades.
Outros Gênios que combatem a depressão:
1->1 VEHUIAH: Concede força de vontade e movimentando a vida;
1->4 ELEMIAH: Da a consciência do que produz o desassossego;
3->2 LAUVIAH: Fornece uma visão melhor do futuro e retira a sensação de impotência. Afasta de nós os ocupantes das baixas esferas;
3->7 YEIAIEL: Desenvolvimento emotivo para vencer as tempestades e os naufrágios emocionais.
5->8 REHAEL: Depressão relativo a conflito superior-inferior, problemas com pai, autoridades;
8->3 YEIALEL: Nos concede a lógica e força mental contra os pensamentos que nos afundam;
9->3 MANAKEL: Atua sobre os sentimentos de culpa nos incutindo a imagem verdadeira;
9->9 MUMIAH: Protege contra o desespero e as tendências suicidas.
1.8              Escrituras:
S.3:3 (3-4) “Tu autem Domine clipeus circa me  gloria mea  et exaltans caput meum.”
“Mas tu, Oh Eterno!  És minha couraça, meu escudo. Tú es a minha glória, e o que exalta a minha cabeça.”
1.9        Orações:
VEHUIAH! Faz que fermentem em mim as tuas virtudes.
Fazei que seja o primeiro a carregar a bandeira,
o primeiro herói e que por Tua graça conduza os homens mais além do humano.
Que ferva em mim a superabundante energia com que se realizam os milagres.
Liberta-me Senhor da turbulência e da cólera
permitindo encontrar no exterior o adequado receptáculo para sua semente.
Comunica-me a sua sagacidade e sutilidade para que possa chegar aos meus ouvidos
a Voz divina e para que possa contemplar com meus olhos a sublime imagem do Pai.
Oh VEHUIAH! Sejas Tu o forjador do qual serei tua bigorna.
Sejas Tu o soprador e eu serei o crisol,
o fogo de teu fogo, a luz de tua luz,
a chama permanentemente viva para que meus irmãos,
de geração em geração,
vislumbrem o seu caminho.
1.10    Exortação:
“O tempo da fermentação é chegado
e o julgo da vinha fermenta debaixo dos raios do sol;
A agua borbulha sob a ação do Fogo e o ferro enrijece ao sopro da Chama;
Há uma vida dentro de tua vida,
um novo estado dentro de seu presente estado de ser,
uma luz vermelha em sua frieza metálica.
O Pai é o Sol, fogo e a Chama
É a força transformadora universal
e que sacará de ti a fertilidade
arrancando-te de sua morte aparente
para criar em ti e, através de ti, nos demais,
o potencial do Eterno.
Venha para a religião do Pai e compreenderás os mistérios que a fé te ocultava.
Compreenderas para que servem
o Amor, os Sofrimentos, as orações e a cadeia de encarnações.
Compreenderas porque é necessário o fracasso e porquê e útil a vitória.
O Pai fará de ti um colaborador consciente de sua Obra.
A religião do Pai te abre agora suas portas,
para que se produza em ti a expansão de consciência
que em tua viagem humana tens buscado.
Oração e exortação de Kabaleb.
[1] Quando terminei o curso de Direito escrevi uma monografia que abarcou Direito e Filosofia com o tema intitulado RAZOABILIDADE. ASPECTOS ESTRUTURAIS, onde propusemos uma estrutura em que a primazia da Razoabilidade abarca todos os demais princípios do Direito. Na época não estava muito bem de saúde, quase não terminamos a obra, contudo o núcleo do tema proposto nos deu a dimensão da centralidade do princípio.

Boa tarde,  gostaria de tirar uma dúvida.
Posso acender três velas de cor vermelha ou é somente como descrito  ?

VEHUIAH está relacionado a Kether, por isto a luz branca, mas também está no signo de Áries cuja cor é vermelha, então vai depender do seu propósito.

Como entrar com ações contra o exame de ordem da OAB? Não há como sustentar a exclusão de +++ 4 MILHÕES +++ de bacharéis de direito que estão fora do mercado de trabalho em virtude do corporativismo, de uma confraria e da reserva de mercado. Este número é absurdo e só tende a aumentar. Para tudo explodir é uma questão de tempo… Milhares de bacharéis estão entrando com as ações.
Na barra a direita e acima possuimos uma Categoria completa, com materiais relativo aos exames de ordem - Decisões - Modelos de petições - Projetos de Lei - e muita matéria do que vem ocorrendo DIVULGUE este material...
Quem sai prejudicado? R. A população mais carente que não pode ter acesso a justiça em virtude do auto custo de um advogado...
Quem defende este exame? R. -> A OAB, advogados que terão que dividir o pão com mais de 4 MILHÕES de Bacharéis que se tornarão Advogados...
Eles lutarão até o último suspiro para que isto não ocorra, mas nos continuaremos lutando quando não houver mais suspiro...

(-) sedição popular, ATAQUES INJUSTOS, celibato, contracepção, maus costumes.
1.3        Movimentação Sephiroth: As na segunda posição.
Ocorre quando o “Yod” se encontra na posição “He”, portanto, fora de sua sede de modo que as circunstâncias é que determinarão o movimento da Vontade, não caberá ao indivíduo controlar o rumo das coisas. As experiências exercerão um papel fundamental e o Amor-sabedoria de Hochmah influenciarão sobremaneira as forças de Kether, como ocorre em uma relação entre casais quando a mulher acaba por influenciar o companheiro.
1.4        Arcano – Mundo: Dois de paus mundo de Atziluth.
Recebe o título de Senhor do domínio. Refere-se ao elemento Fogo e astrologicamente corresponde a posição de Urano transitando pelo segundo decanato de Áries onde manifesta seus fluxos mediante as roupagens deste signo e sob as pulsações do regente deste decanato que é o Urano.
Neste ponto, Kether o primeiro ponto de partida na Arvore e no zodíaco, o centro produtor de iniciativas, a essência divina, expressa-se por intermédio de Hochmah o centro produtor de Amor-Sabedoria, o Amor universal, a essência Crística. No mais, o resultado desta alquimia se exteriorizara ainda pelo tom prismático de Tiphereth, o coordenador deste subciclo evolutivo.
Aqui as forças de Kether se veem neutralizadas, eis que a vontade primordial queda prisioneiro do amor. Uma vez que a vontade esteja aprisionada, as virtudes do “Um” não podem manifestar-se. Em razão disto os mananciais de Kether como liberdade e supremo desígnio quedam como inertes.
No campo prático, algo que havia sido posto em andamento vê-se neutralizado e ao invés de exteriorizar-se pela força de Kether retém-se nas interiorizações de Hochmah. A paixão aprisiona a Vontade tornando-a passiva, i.e., sem existência. A força criadora é dominada antes que venha a produzir qualquer coisa, eis que a primeira produção só aparecera após a manifestação do três – em Binah.
Quando o dois de paus atua no mundo de Atziluth indica que esta neutralidade se efetua desde o ponto de sua geração, refere-se a um natimorto, por isto esta carta invertida muitas vezes é interpretada como uma surpresa, um milagre.
1.5        Virtudes concedidas:
1º.- Fecundidade, tanto nas pessoas, como nos animais e plantas.
2º.- El restabelecimento da paz entre esposos e fidelidade conjugal.
3º.- Conseguir que os subordinados sejam fiéis ao Rei e aos governantes legítimos.
4º.- Pode invocar lhe para calmar as sedições populares e conseguir a vitória contra os ataques injustos.
5º.- Fazer que abandonem o celibato e os maus costumes os que se obstinam em viver sós.
1.6        Descrição Sephiroth:
JELIEL é o segundo da 1º ordem de anjos denominado como Coro dos Serafins, situa-se na morada filosofal de número 2, rege o sendeiro 11, que une Kether a Hochmah em sua trajetória de ida ou descenso pelas árvore e zodíaco. Trata das forças de Kether o primeiro ponto de partida na Arvore e no zodíaco, o centro produtor de iniciativas, a essência divina e, neste ponto, manifesta seus fluxos mediante as pulsações de Hochmah o centro produtor de Amor-Sabedoria, o Amor universal, a essência Crística; o “Yod” do Mundo de Atziluth sobre o “He” do Mundo de Atziluth, Fogo do Fogo atuando sobre o Agua do Fogo. Nesta casa nos deparamos com a essência filosofal chamada MANANCIAL DE AMOR E ETERNA SABEDORIA, o conjunto de qualidades, propriedades e atributos que tratam da “água que se bebe e nunca mais se tem sede”, o Amor e a Vontade são uma mesma coisa já que Kether e Hochmah são Uno e termina por se projetar em todas as coisas. Trata-se de uma força de Vontade de amor e sabedoria, que ocorre quando a Vontade se submerge em um manancial de Amor-sabedoria convertendo ambos em uma mesma coisa e como se trata de um amor Universal atuará desde dentro já que Hochmah o primogênito de Kether e da coluna da direita, trabalha, portanto, a nível interno acalmando as sedições de modo que as manifestarão espelharão o interior. Cabe esclarecer aqui que ao filho cumpre realizar a Vontade do Pai, de modo que, Hochmah exerce as circunstâncias e energia favoráveis para que esta Vontade se cumpra. Neste ponto encontra-se presente a força engendrante de Kether e a gastadora de Hochmah. É, portanto um portador de fidelidade, sorte, fortuna, inspiração, mas com vistas ao Amor primordial, desinteressado. Daí vem o atributo, esta qualidade imbuída de poder denominada Deus que socorre.
Cabe notar que o caminho 11 (veja a árvore Sephiroth), rege o sendeiro de ida ou descenso as realidades materiais tanto pela árvore como pelo zodíaco, refere-se as relações de Kether-Hochmah e que, portanto, é regida por Kether, por ser o Gênio número um e também por estarmos tratando do primeiro caminho ou sendeiro de ligação entre dois centros de vida e, assim sendo, encerra em si todas as potencialidades da Vontade em união ao puro amor próprio de Hochmah, daí que Amor e Vontade encontrem uma conexão osmótica.
Hochmah-Urano e conhecido na arvore cabalística por ser o manancial de amor e sabedoria. Ou seja, o amor é tido como o mais alto grau da sabedoria. A sabedoria está acima da inteligência na escala evolutiva Sephiroth. Trata-se da sabedoria Crística referida como “a água que se bebe e nunca mais se tem sede” eis que proceda da fonte primeira e eterna quando VEHUIAH, depois de realizados seus trabalhos, submerge a Vontade em um manancial de amor.
Em Hochmah-Urano é quando ocorre a divisão da unidade e surge então a dualidade cujo meio de se voltar a Unidade primogênita é justamente pelas vias do Amor. Como ocorre com dois irmãos que se partem e, com sabedoria, ajustam suas posições para unirem-se novamente em uma só vontade.
Percebemos que Amor e Vontade são uma mesma coisa e nesse sentido lembramos a sabedoria de Cristo em sua afirmação “quem viu ao Filho viu ao Pai”.
JELIEL é, portanto, a manifestação do amor desinteressado, caridoso, que pratica a bondade não importando o porquê ou a quem. O amor primeiro é posto acima de todas as coisas, sem necessidade de triunfos, agradecimentos e em contrapartida faz descer sobre nós o jorro de luz que dá a vitória a nossas empresas, nos concede a inspiração necessária que é a matéria prima de JELIEL já que a inspiração primeira vem da segunda morada, desta região chamada Amor-Sabedoria. Esta energia faz com que sejamos um farol de luz, a providência que se manifesta e, em nós as pessoas encontrarão o seu Norte para uma terra farta e acolhedora.
Se em nossos alforjes (mala, bolsa espiritual) acumulamos estas essências seremos   guia para os demais, como o foi Jesus, Buda, Krishina, Quetzalcoatl, Osíris (para uns e Hórus para outros), entre tantos grandes mestres espirituais fundadores, mas também como Gandhi e outros que nos demonstram a história e que guiaram com Amor-Sabedoria.
1.7        Das virtudes concedidas:
1.7.1    Fecundidade, tanto nas pessoas, como nos animais e plantas.
Estas forças influem sobre a geração de todos os seres que existem no reino animal, vegetal etc.
A geração é uma combinação da parte masculina VEHUIAH coma parte feminina JELIEL; do Adam Kadmon, o homem arquétipo, primordial, com Eva ou Aisha, a natureza essência, mulher primordial, arquétipo feminino que sendo também primordial em si, embora posterior a Adam Kadmon, carrega em si a essência da vontade.
A união de Kether-Hochmah em JELIEL é a combinação do fogo com a agua, dois elementos antagônicos, como o positivo e o negativo, mas capaz de geração o que significa: fecundidade em todos os aspectos, inclusive o bom relacionamento conjugal.
JELIEL atua posteriormente a VEHUIAH que é o primeiro. Sendo aquele a parte feminina, está diretamente ligada a fecundidade, fertilidade, natureza que fecunda por onde sairão os seres que, no momento certo, escolheram este canal para sua exteriorização. Assim, Aisha torna-se um “Yod” em seu departamento.
Cabe ainda destacar que as pulsações de JELIEL faz com que seus influenciados sejam portadores de espíritos brincalhões, jovial, descontraídos, com maneiras agradáveis que atraem as pessoas em um jogo perigoso e apaixonante quanto mais o seja rumo a sexualidade. Estando JELIEL em um plano muito alto, afastado das realidades materiais dos problemas do mundo físico, quando ocorram as controvérsias não lhes trarão grandes perturbações, conflitos.
Hochmah propicia circunstâncias favoráveis para que se cumpra à vontade já iniciada, deste modo, o homem de JELIEL é um portador de sorte extraordinária, um amuleto ambulante, um trevo de quatro flores já que a providência beneficia inclusive os que o rodeiam. Alguém que age de forma desinteressado, por amor.
Abrimos um parêntese para explanar o trevo de quatro folhas, uma representação de Hesed/Júpiter onde desaguam o manancial da bondade suprema das três séfiras superiores do triângulo logoico a saber Kether, Hochmah e Binah. O quatro é o resultado final da união das três forças primárias, quando a trindade se une a unidade, também conhecido como o Tetragrammaton.
Estas pessoas serão apaixonadas pela criação, pelo positivo e, portanto, também pelo sexo, principalmente por sua qualidade de órgão de aliança com Deus e, em razão do que, se multiplica e se expande a obra divina em todos os reinos. É comum que tenham muitas proles. Que sejam chefes de grandes famílias.
Cabe ressaltar aqui que o sexo como aliança com Deus tem sido alvo de muitas interpretações restritivas, opressivas no curso dos milênios. Tal fato ocorre em razão da proximidade de uma energia muito poderosa com o Criador. Contudo refere-se ainda a uma forma de utilização desta energia sem que haja seu desperdício, de modo que possa ser utilizada nas dimensões superiores da natureza que resultam inclusive em mudanças em Malkuth já que toda a criação vem de cima para baixo.
As escrituras afirmam que no paraíso havia duas arvores distintas: Uma chamava-se “Árvore do conhecimento do bem e do mal” e a outra chamava-se “Arvore da vida”.
Uma parte da árvore da ciência do bem e do mal estamos passando nestes textos. Quanto a arvore da vida são segredos que se referem ao sexo. Afinal toda criação tem origem sexual. No desenvolver do curso trataremos do tema.
1.7.2    O restabelecimento da paz entre esposos e fidelidade conjugal.
Cristo por diversas vezes afirmou ser “Um” com o Pai. Assim é também em nossa personalidade representadas pelo Kether-Sol e Lua-Hochmah se considerarmos a coluna do meio da Árvore. Deste modo quando da atuação de JELIEL, representante de Hochmah, atua em nós, unifica os dois aspectos interno em nosso interior, restabelecendo a paz entre esposos e a fidelidade conjugal. Isto ocorre em razão de que havendo alcançado a Unidade interna, esta será projetada para o exterior facilitando o entendimento e a perfeição no relacionamento.
Nos dias e horas de JELIEL aparecerão em conversas, discursos, redes sociais, imprensa em geral os temas ligados ao bom relacionamento entre esposos.
Outros Gênios que nos auxiliam a viver em paz:
1->2 JELIEL: Restabelece a paz entre esposos pela união da Vontade e Amor-sabedoria;
1->5 MAHASIAH: Pela retificação dos erros e sincronicidade com os desígnios divinos;
1->6 LELAHEL: Paz fruto da Vontade harmoniosa, pacífica e consciente;
4->2 NITH-HAIAH: Paz da solidão para alcançar a verdade e a sabedoria;
4->4 YERATHEL: Paz em ambiente justo e homens sábios;
5->3 LEHAHIAH: Paz entre os governantes – sem guerras. Guerra contra os desejos;
5->4 CHAVAKIAH: Paz e harmonia nas famílias e com todos, reconciliação com o passado;
5->7 HAAMIAH: Viver em Paz com a sociedade, proteção espiritual;
5->9 IEIAZEL: Para que os inimigos nos deixem em paz em razão de uma Nova Realidade;
6->4 VEULIAH: Paz mediante a guerra para retirada do usurpador e, pelo perfeito ordenamento natural das coisas na dinâmica יהוה;
6->5 YLAHIAH: Disposição para a paz com inimigos que fomos injustos;
6->9 MIHAEL: Paz e harmonia entre esposos;
8->7 IAH-HEL: Tranquilidade e solidão para alcançar a sabedoria;
9->8 HAIAIEL: Destruição da babilónia interna e externa, paz para quem está em guerra.
1.7.3    Conseguir que os subordinados sejam fiéis ao Rei e aos governantes legítimos.
O programa afirma que este Gênio tem domínio sobre os reis e os príncipes, mantém seus súditos na obediência.
Em nossos mundos internos Kether é o rei e Hochmah o príncipe; contudo JELIEL -“He” (fórmula: יהוה – “Yod-He-Vô-He”.) é o elemento interiorizador no triangulo logoico composto por Kether, Hochmah e Binah já que é a terra onde será plantada a semente. Assim, JELIEL que carrega VEHUIAH dentro de si acaba por representar a ambos já que, como explanamos, é o momento em que a vontade se submerge em um manancial de Amor-sabedoria convertendo ambos em uma mesma coisa.
O mesmo ocorre na vida exterior a exemplo da mulher grávida que carrega a semente do esposo. A vontade soberana representa o rei; o amor, a sua primeira emanação e o filho do rei é a semente engendrada. Sendo este o ponto de arranque de tudo (Vontade-Amor) daí vem as ordens que serão executadas pelos servidores do rei-príncipe: Adam Kadmon/Eva Aisha.
JELIEL promove a unidade de desígnios, e quando tratamos dos governantes legítimos refere-se a uma relação intrínseca com as forças universais, já que Kether é o soberano incontestável e Hochmah seu herdeiro natural e, do mesmo modo, estas energias propulsarão no domínio exterior, desde o interior que posteriormente é projetada ao externo de modo que haja um perfeito entendimento entre subordinados e seus superiores, deste modo tudo fluirá em consonância com as pulsações cósmicas.
Outros gênios que tratam da fidelidade:
1->2 JELIEL: Fidelidade conjugal, dos subordinados ao rei e aos governantes por unidade de desígnio;
2->6 IEZALEL: Fidelidade conjugal e reconciliação entre esposos;
5->2 YEHUIAH: obediência e fidelidade dos subordinados;
6->3 MIKAEL: Obediência e fidelidade ao legítimo, líderes naturais;
6->9 MIHAEL: Fidelidade conjugal;
8->5 MITZRAEL: Fidelidade e obediência dos subordinados.
1.7.4    Pode invocar lhe para calmar as sedições populares e conseguir a vitória contra os ataques injustos.
O amor-sabedoria é um motor propulsor, eis que a Vontade mergulha no Amor-sabedoria, e sendo JELIEL uma emanação, um desdobramento de VEHUIAH, neste motor encontra-se à vontade, e mais, uma vontade visível, uma emanação que nos serve de guia.
Quando nossos impulsos internos ocupam nossas cidades anímicas (cidades em nossa psiquê, nosso subconsciente) reivindicando assuntos diversos, a fim de reivindicar coisas mil, JELIEL aparece a acalma tudo dando uma visão geral das coisas e que, com paciência, poderão adquiri-las já que tudo o que está em cima um dia chegará em baixo. Faz com que tudo se desenvolvam da melhor maneira possível em um ambiente favorável e sem hostilidade.
Restabelece a calma porque destila a paz infinita que provém de Hochmah possuidor do atributo “amor supremo”, por estar na emanação fazendo topo com a Vontade, que envolve os impulsos dando um sentimento de satisfação e, assim, já não desejam mais nada a não ser embriagar-se do estado em que lhes deixou o ópio do amor. Neste diapasão reina o amor a sabedoria na vida do indivíduo e como resultado encontra a paz interior.
E como o exterior é o reflexo do interior, acalmando-se as sedições internas as externas se acalmarão como consequência.
O amor é tido como o segundo na hierarquia dos valores eternos sendo, o primeiro a vontade segunda sem a qual nada se cria ou se estabelece, isto faz com que tudo se submeta a ela, já que a primeira força e ativa e a segunda é passiva. As primeiras energias a submeterem-se ao amor são as injustiças; daí advém o triunfo sobre as situações injustas que submerge no reino do amor, da bondade peculiares a Hochmah – Cristo.
Temos visto que encontramos em Hochmah a mulher primordial, a Eva, AISHA, o suporte da vontade. Basta lembrar que segundo as escrituras Eva foi extraída da coluna de Adão – o homem primordial, ligado a Kether -, horas a vontade está representada na coluna vertebral que dá sustentação a todo o corpo. Como Hochmah é um desdobramento de Kether pode-se afirmar que se trata da costela retirada de adão.
Esta alegoria nos informa como as energias eternas estão ordenadas nos universos e dentro de nossa psique, afinal “como é em cima, o é em baixo e vice-versa”.
Prosseguindo, na cosmologia da criação vemos que da união de Kether-Hochmah surgira Binah – ressalte-se: o elo de ligação entre os dois primeiros -, e por meio desta sephira surgirá toda a criação. Temos aqui o Pai-Kether, o Filho-Hochmah e o Espírito Santo Binah, a tríade responsável por tudo quanto existe: O positivo, o negativo e o neutro; o vermelho, o azul e o amarelo (enquanto escrevo estas linhas me vem à mente o hidrogênio, o carbono e o hélio).
Relembramos aqui novamente que Cristo afirmou que Kether e Hochmah são Uno.
Outros gênios que tratam das sedições populares:
1->2 JELIEL: Fidelidade dos subordinados ao rei e aos governantes por unidade de desígnio;
2->9 HEKAMIAH: Lealdade as coroas, governantes, íntegros, legítimos.
1.7.5    Fazer que abandonem o celibato e os maus costumes os que se obstinam em viver sós.
O lado negativo da força
O gênio contrário tem domínio sobre tudo o que é nocivo aos seres vivos, gosta de desunir os esposos, desviando-os de seus deveres (inclusive conjugais), inspira o gosto pelo celibato e os maus costumes.
Estas energias referem-se aos atos contra a criação, os maus costumes. A cabala afirma que estão nesta categoria os que se negam a ter filhos a ampliar a obra da criação, sejam casados ou não. Neste sentido é entendido como o primeiro atentado contra a ordem cósmica que vem desde o alto, ou seja, a criação, criar.
Mas isto não se restringe somente aos humanos. Entram também as castrações, os alimentos transgênicos já que impedem que a semente se reproduza disseminando assim o protótipo da infertilidade etc.
Os que advogam agressivamente contra a geração, os que lucram com isto, etc. estão ligados a esta fonte abismal de energia. Trata-se do mais alto crime contra a natureza pois é uma sentença de morte pré-embrionária contrária a ordem natural e que impede a proliferação de vida e a consequente manutenção de tudo quanto existe.
Aqui não estamos falando ainda sobre os abortos, trataremos mais sobre este tema ao adentrarmos nos assuntos do gênio OMAEL (30).
Devemos lembrar que em Hochmah encontramos a raiz da misericórdia que posteriormente se manifestará em Hesed. É nesse sentido que devemos trabalhar a questão da castração por motivos de doença, já que há a impossibilidade de procriar-se sem ausência de sofrimento ou risco de vida.
De outro lado ainda algumas pessoas estão liberadas de ter filhos seja por ter superado este tipo de trabalho, seja missão, enfim, são exceções.
Há ainda a questão do celibato que além de ir contra a criação exclui o outro que levamos dentro de nós reduzindo-nos a metade de nós mesmos. Sendo o celibato uma agressão contra a natureza, violadora da ordem natural, a energia não utilizada na criação de corpos físicos ou espirituais que se acumula, acaba por retornar contra aquele que o prática em uma relação de causa e efeito, dando origem ao homossexualismo, a pedofilia, distúrbios mentais e outras formas de energias que não comportam o dique, o equilíbrio energético. Falaremos mais sobre o assunto no momento oportuno.
Os maus costumes são tudo aquilo que vão contra os parâmetros cósmicos e que dadas as condições de vida custam muito a erradicar e, como estamos tratando de energias criadoras, estão relacionados a estas. Faz com que o indivíduo atinja o fundo do poço até que chegue o dia em que de algum modo, atingindo o seu ponto de saturação, a energia de JELIEL o saque do abismo.
No evangelho o Kabir Jesus expulsava legiões. Uma referência a que os defeitos psicológicos nunca estão sozinhos, mas acompanhados de muitos outros, uns dando sustentação aos outros em um verdadeiro emaranhado de apoios e justificações, assemelha-se muito ao nosso atual sistema político degradado.
As energias de JELIEL não utilizadas corretamente são precipitadas para os abismos do inconsciente e se projetam em manifestações negativas em Malkuth (o mundo físico), e no caso do casal, a única saída mirada passa a ser a separação.
Aqui aparecem ainda as pessoas que atuam somente por interesse já que se refere a contrapartida do altruísmo de JELIEL.
1.8        Escrituras
S 22:19 (21-20) “Tu autem Domine ne longe fias fortitudo mea in auxilium meum festina.”
“Mas tu, Eterno, fiques perto de mim: Tu es minha força, apressa-te em socorrer-me! ”
1.9        Oração
JELIEL: Deus que socorre.
JELIEL: Presta-me teu auxílio, Senhor dos brilhantes conceitos,
para que possa aportar claridade onde reina a confusão;
para que possa aportar método onde tudo é caos.
Permite-me, Senhor JELIEL,
guardar sempre minha inteligência, pura, limpa,
sem que possa torcer-se ante a pressão
dos interesses materiais;
para ser aquele que, graças a teus poderes,
dá um conselho desinteressado, um juízo construtivo.
Faz que essa voz que emerge das profundidades de meu ser,
seja a que dirige e orquestre mi vida.
Faz que seja impossível todo pacto, todo compromisso, entre a razão e os instintos,
y que a mente domine as emoções como o ginete domina seu cavalo.
Faz que tua brilhante penetração dentro de mim
não me induza em erro e chegue a pensar
que a luz vem de mim e não de ti.
Em todo momento y em todo lugar, Oh Senhor JELIEL!
Faz-me um homem desinteressado”.
1.10        Exortação
“O que tens feito hoje para melhorar a qualidade do mundo?
Tens dado as estruturas físicas a tua luz?
Ou por acaso tens aportado a terra em que vives um pouco mais de sombra?
Pergunto-lhe, peregrino.
E se fordes um semeador de sombras, um produtor de trevas quero que saibas que tens a tua disposição uma imensa claridade, um deslumbrante resplendor ofuscante.
Não necessitas mais do que abrir em sua própria consciência um canal,
e um jato luminoso de Alef (Alfa – energia primordial)
inundará seus Centros de Percepção.
Então tudo mudará ao seu redor;
Viveras em alegria em um transbordante entusiasmo,
porque terás a sensação de aportar ao mundo a ao seres que o rodeiam
algo tão necessário para a vida como o ar que respiras.
Chama-me, aproxima-se de minha esfera,
e este bem estar que tenho para ti, será teu.
Quanto hajas bebido meu Fogo,
os objetivos materiais desaparecerão de tua estratégia
e serás um obreiro do Templo do Espírito.
Trabalharas para que o mundo deixe de ser um vasto campo de desperdícios
e em ti se alojará permanentemente a felicidade.
Oração e exortação de Kabaleb.

Juramento do Bacharel em Direito "JURO, COMO BACHAREL EM DIREITO, NO EXERCÍCIO DAS MINHAS FUNÇÕES E DO MEU OFÍCIO, RESPEITAR OS PRINCÍPIOS SOBRE OS QUAIS SE ASSENTAM AS LEIS, GUIAR-ME À LUZ DA ÉTICA, SEMPRE EM BUSCA DA JUSTIÇA, E DOS VALORES HUMANOS, VALENDO-ME DO DIREITO COMO INSTRUMENTO MÁXIMO PARA ASSEGURAR AOS HOMENS OS SEUS DIREITOS FUNDAMENTAIS E INTOCÁVEIS, SEM DISTINÇÃO DE QUALQUER NATUREZA.  E, ACIMA DE TUDO DEFENDER A LIBERDADE, POIS SEM ELA NÃO HÁ DIREITO QUE SOBREVIVA, NEM PAZ QUE SE CONCRETIZE."!
Observações sobre os comentários. Os comentários não refletem necessariamente a opinião dos responsáveis pelo Blog. É da responsabilidade integral de quem os postar.
“Posso nao concordar com o que você faz, mas lutarei até a morte pelo seu direito de continuar fazendo.”  Voltaire
Como entrar com ações contra o exame de ordem da OAB? Não há como sustentar a exclusão de +++ 4 MILHÕES +++ de bacharéis de direito que estão fora do mercado de trabalho em virtude do corporativismo, de uma confraria e da reserva de mercado. Este número é absurdo e só tende a aumentar. Para tudo explodir é uma questão de tempo… Milhares de bacharéis estão entrando com as ações.
Na barra a direita e acima possuimos uma Categoria completa, com materiais relativo aos exames de ordem - Decisões - Modelos de petições - Projetos de Lei - e muita matéria do que vem ocorrendo DIVULGUE este material...
Quem sai prejudicado? R. A população mais carente que não pode ter acesso a justiça em virtude do auto custo de um advogado...
Quem defende este exame? R. -> A OAB, advogados que terão que dividir o pão com mais de 4 MILHÕES de Bacharéis que se tornarão Advogados...
Eles lutarão até o último suspiro para que isto não ocorra, mas nos continuaremos lutando quando não houver mais suspiro...

Bons empregos, ADVERSIDADES, mediação, VENCER AS FORÇAS DO MAL, sedições populares, PALAVRA DADA, construção NEGOCIAÇÃO DO KARMA.
(-) Magia negra, descumprimento de contrato, hipocrisia, ingratidão, perjúrio.
1.3        Movimentação Sephiroth: As na terceira posição
O As na terceira posição situa-se em Binah, e também esta fora de seu lugar que é o topo. Exerce uma função exteriorizadora forçada, algo como um aborto já que a semente se manifesta como fruto, fora de seu tempo, uma antecipação do processo natural onde o produto pode não ser tragável, consumível. Em termos materiais refere-se aquele que liquida seu patrimônio, seus créditos, prestígios, que torra o capital no lugar de fazê-lo trabalhar para daí extrair os benefícios.
1.4        Arcano – Mundo: Três de paus no mundo de Atziluth
Recebe o título de Senhor da força estabelecida. Refere-se ao elemento Fogo e astrologicamente corresponde a posição de Saturno transitando pelo terceiro decanato de Áries onde manifesta seus fluxos mediante as roupagens deste signo e sob as pulsações do regente deste decanato que é o Saturno.
Neste ponto, Kether o primeiro ponto de partida na Árvore e no zodíaco, o centro produtor de iniciativas, a essência divina, expressa-se por intermédio de Binah o construtor do universo, centro instituidor de todas as coisas de onde emanam a Lei e a ordem. No mais, o resultado desta alquimia se exteriorizara ainda pelo tom prismático de Hesed, o coordenador deste subciclo evolutivo.
O três de paus representa o “Vô” de “Yod” já que o “Vô” é a terceira manifestação do nome impronunciável “YHVH” (יהוה – “Yod-He-Vô-He”) mais conhecido como Jehovah. O naipe de paus que governa a carta está relacionado com a “Yod” a primeira letra do nome. Isto indica que Binah estabelece, consolida a vontade emanada de Kether concretizando o designo primordial. Algo que até então seria intenção, potência e que passa a ser uma realidade, ato manifesto.
Quando o Três de paus atua mundo de Atziluth o faz no plano das emanações e trabalha a nível da vontade que orientara o descenso das energias, a força encontra-se estabelecida desde um ponto em que atua sob o manto do destino, como vontade primordial.

1.6        Descrição Sephiroth:
SITAEL é o terceiro da 1ª ordem de anjos denominado como Coro dos Serafins, situa-se na morada filosofal de número 3, rege o sendeiro 12, que une Kether a Binah em sua trajetória de ida ou descenso pela árvore e zodíaco. Trata das forças de Kether o primeiro ponto de partida na Arvore e no zodíaco, o centro produtor de iniciativas, a essência divina e, neste ponto, manifesta seus fluxos mediante as pulsações de Binah o construtor do universo, centro instituidor de todas as coisas de onde emanam a Lei e a ordem; “Yod” do Mundo de Atziluth sobre o “Vô” do Mundo de Atziluth, Fogo do Fogo atuando sobre o Ar do Fogo. Nesta casa nos deparamos com a essência filosofal chamada VONTADE CONSTRUTORA, o conjunto de qualidades, propriedades e atributos que propicia a construção de tudo o que existiu, existe ou venha a existir. Trata-se de uma força de Vontade Legisladora, Regulamentadora, Ordenadora, já que toda construção é feita mediante as regras, tudo tem sua medida, seu número. Tudo o que se cria, se cristaliza já sai com o selo do Justo, com a certeza, a segurança de que é e será como deve ser, i.e., seguindo o Ordenamento Cósmico Universal. Esta força promove a reordenação do adverso, retifica tudo o que esteja contrária ao regramento cósmico, coloca tudo em seu ritmo, biorritmo natural já que a Vontade Ketheriana se expressa pelas vias do Grande Arquiteto sediado em Binah. Daí vem o atributo, esta qualidade imbuída de poder denominada Deus esperança de todas as criaturas.
Cabe notar que o caminho 12 (veja a árvore Sephiroth), rege o sendeiro de ida ou descenso as realidades materiais tanto pela árvore como pelo zodíaco, refere-se as relações de Kether-Binah e, portanto, é regida por Hochmah. E, por ser o Gênio número dois, cuida do segundo caminho de união entre dois centros de vida, dessarte, encerra em si todas as potencialidades do puro amor próprio de Hochmah.
Na mitologia grega vemos a terceira séfira simbolizada por Chronos o mais jovem dos titãs, filho de Urano, já que vem após este, o senhor do tempo eis que sendo o construtor primeiro o “tempo” inicia-se por ele. Chronos devorava seus filhos, alusão a que o tempo devora toda a criação eis que o que tem um princípio tem também um fim.
A pedido de sua mãe Gaia, a terra primordial, tornou-se senhor do céu, castrando seu pai com um golpe de foice que é símbolo da morte. No esoterismo o anjo da morte tem sua morada em Saturno-Binah. Toda manifestação começa e toda manifestação termina em saturno. A castração de seu pai pretende demonstrar onde começa e termina a manifestação da criação, quando tudo o que saiu do Absoluto: a ele retorna.
De temperamento violento e vingativo, que representa a Lei de causa e efeito, nos lembra o Jehovah (YHVH – יהוה – Yod-He-Vô-He) bíblico, eis que sendo o Grande Arquiteto (termo maçônico) e legislador carrega em seu nome e em sua essência os segredos da construção dos universos.
Seu temperamento vingativo vem do fato de ser o promulgador das Leis e estar no topo do pilar da severidade, situado no lado esquerdo da arvore Sephiroth compostos por Binah, Geburah e Hod. Uma exigência kármica, uma relação de causa e efeito, de que tudo seja conforme com sua vontade.
Os 72 Gênios foram extraídos do nome de Jehovah. Para entender de forma abstrata, o processo de manifestação da criação, basta uma pequena análise da geometria.
Ao mover um ponto em uma direção qualquer criamos uma reta. Em um segundo momento movemos o ponto a partir da reta anterior, onde terminou o movimento e teremos outra reta ligada a primeira. Em um terceiro movimento juntamos os dois pontos soltos resultantes dos movimentos anteriores e teremos originado um triangulo r.
Veja que a primeira figura geométrica, a primeira forma, que existe resultante das energias dispendidas anteriormente é o triângulo e que antes disto não havia criação. Somente da união das duas é que surge a primeira forma.
De outro modo podemos conceber que Kether, simbolizado por um ponto, que parta para o infinito em uma linha unidimensional chamada Hochmah e corte o espaço até que um dia se encontre e corte a trajetória de Hochmah em um ponto de união chamado Binah formando um círculo.
Assim temos em Kether o ponto primordial e em Hochmah a “dualidade primeira” em desequilibro até que encontre um ponto de união que contenha a energia que se encontrava, até então, em uma expansão sem limites posta agora em uma forma dando, assim, origem a criação. Trata-se portando do poder cristalizador de qualquer realidade por isto é denominado o construtor do universo.
A forma é o ponto de apoio de Arquimedes para toda criação física ou espiritual que quando volte ao seio do absoluto será desintegrada e a energia se veja livre novamente. A materialização, portanto, consiste no aprisionamento da energia, seja em que nível for.
“Vô” é o terceiro movimento da fórmula YHVH. A união Pai, Filho e Espírito Santo dos Cristãos; positivo negativo e neutro da ciência; vermelho, azul e amarelo do pintor; Kether, Hochmah e Binah dos cabalistas; Osíris, Ísis e Hórus, no Egito; Brama, Vishnu e Shiva, na Índia; enxofre, mercúrio e o sal dos alquimistas; largura, altura e comprimento da geometria; próton elétron e neutro do átomo; fato, valor e norma; sociologia, filosofia e direito na composição das Leis. O homem, a mulher, o falo e o útero em união que originará um novo “Yod”. Seja lá qual for o nome que escolhermos, tratar-se-á das mesmas coisas, pois tudo tem a mesma origem na criação e fora disto nada se cria ou se desenvolve.
1.7        Das virtudes concedidas:
1.7.1    O acesso a empregos superiores com responsabilidades executivas.
SITAEL está em alto grau na escala jerárquica atuando com fortes influências de Kether desde Atziluth de onde emana o rei e, como um administrador das regras de Binah, por isto domina a nobreza como um dom divino e daí a magnitude, os grandes empregos.
É nobre, o que emana do rei, o que Deus reconhece como seu. Os gestos nobres são aqueles emanados pelo grande Arquiteto internos que está ligado a Binah. Desta forma o domínio sobre a nobreza implica que na construção da sociedade utilizemos os materiais provenientes de nosso Binah interno, segundo nossa divindade interior. Poderemos assim, edificar a cidade anímica perfeita que se exteriorizará cada vez mais até a chegada ao mundo físico dando lugar a construção de uma cidade física perfeita em que habitará uma sociedade harmoniosa que funciona ao ritmo da dinâmica divina.
Armazenar as essências de SITAEL em nossos espaços internos nos torna uma linhagem nobre onde o mundo em que vivemos passa a ser projetado por nossa divindade interna. Nos tornaremos embaixadores de SITAEL ajudando aos demais a superar as adversidades.
Como estamos tratando de construtores do mais alto escalão é claro que os bons empregos advirão como consequência já que não se pode construir uma sociedade no político, social e material se não ocupamos posições de destaque que nos permitam atuar. Desta dinâmica pode advir uma missão superior ou um desígnio de nossa divindade interna que se manifesta na vontade de atuar.
Para adquirir o poder devemos estar preparados interna e externamente, lembrar-nos que somos apenas depositários, a fim de que as vaidades, abusos não sejam originadoras de karma. Devemos estar plenamente conscientes de que o poder corrompe e deve ser utilizado com o máximo cuidado e parcimônia. Dizer sim quando se pode dizer sim e, dizer não quando o não é que deve ser dito, é uma arte, um dever, e um grande cuidado cuja utilização e ponderada apenas pelo isentos de espíritos, pelos sábios e, cabe aqui lembrar, que o segundo caminho de união entre os dois centros de vida, de Kether a Binah, e regido por Hochmah – Amor-sabedoria.
O mundo de Binah é a fonte de toda a hierarquia perfeitamente organizada e, por conseguinte o domínio de SITAEL nos tornam mestres construtores, engenheiros, arquitetos, políticos do legislativo, diretores, generais. Muitos planetas nesta morada filosófica indicam grande poder, interpretação social cabalística.
1.7.2    Para pôr fim às adversidades.
O adverso e o fruto, o resultado de algo contrário as leis cósmicas. Seu impulso é uma força ao revés, uma força abismal, seja do nosso subconsciente ou fora de nós em uma manifestação física qualquer.
Estas ações abismais podem ser vistas como algo natural quando a arvore, o pentagrama está invertido, quando andamos de cabeça pra baixo. É quando a pessoa vai perdendo sua essência, sua alma, tornando-se habitantes dos abismos mesmo com corpo físico funcionando na terra, e já não se importa mais com o que faz. Em casos extremos se torna o que se denomina “casa vazia”, eis que o corpo existe, mas já não tem alma, uma consciência que lhe cause o desconforto pelos maus atos, torna-se, portanto uma mera casca ao Léo das energias degradadas.
Segundo os preceitos ocultos, inclusive explanados por HPB, a fisiologia espiritual compõe-se de 7 planos distintos, vamos listá-los de cima para baixo.
Atman – O raio do Absoluto, nossa Essência Divina, Hesed, Júpiter;
Budhi – Nossa Alma Divina, Geburah, Marte;
Manas – Nossa Alma Humana, ou Mente Divina. É o elo entre a Díade Atman-Budhi e nossos princípios inferiores; O corpo causal de Manas inferior, Thipheret, Sol, 6ª dimensão;
Kâma rupa – O corpo de desejos ou corpo emocional, o corpo astral, Netza, venuz, 5ª dimensão;
Linga sharira – O corpo mental, Hod, mercúrio, 5ª dimensão;
Prâna – O corpo vital, Yesod, lua, 4ª dimensão;
Sthula sharira – O corpo físico, corpo denso – Malkuth, terra, 3ª dimensão.
A intuição é a capacidade de nos comunicarmos com o Pai interno, pelas vias da dimensão intitulada Atman, a resultante da Triade Logoica, e por isto, possui todos os poderes que existem, sendo, portanto, onipotente; que está em tudo e em todos pois é a constituição de todas as coisas, por isto é onipresente; por ser a substância presente em todas as coisas, por estar em tudo e tudo estar em si, conhece tudo sendo assim onisciente. A nossa alma humana nos põe em contato com a 6ª dimensão que é mundo causal, também conhecido como mundo Crístico. Antes que qualquer coisa tome existência, teve que existir antes no mundo das causas naturais. Somente as grandes almas tem acesso a este reino. Os magos comuns conseguem atuar e ver apenas até a 5ª dimensão inferior – mundos mental e astral. A 6ª dimensão é o próprio nirvana.
O mundo Crístico da 6ª dimensão é um espelhamento de Kether, o Pai que não pode ser visto diretamente. Lembramos aqui que Moises somente poderia tratar com Deus estando este de costa e mais uma vez a figura do Cristo se insurge dizendo “quem viu a mim, viu ao Pai”.
Pois sendo a intuição um atributo da alma, somente quem a tem, quem conseguiu fabricá-la pode ter acesso aos planos superiores. Para se fabricar a alma exige-se uma quantidade enorme de energia, um trabalho que pode durar anos ou séculos. Exige muita disciplina, dedicação e observação as Leis cósmicas tanto materiais como do espírito que está a cargo dos mistérios ocultos no nome Jehovah – YHVH.
O pentagrama está correto, alegoria da ordem cósmica, quando uma ponta está para cima e duas para baixo e está invertido quando uma ponta está para baixo e duas para cima. Simboliza as quatro letras do nome de Jehovah – YHVH composto pelos braços e pernas sendo a cabeça o símbolo do espírito que comanda a operação. Cada membro do pentagrama corresponde a um dos quatro elementos e a cabeça ao Éter. Acrescentando-se a letra hebraica Shin (ש) no meio, na cabeça obtemos YHShVH que é o nome Yeheshuah cuja tradução hebraica ocidental é Jesus. Uma referência ao espírito Crístico dominando as quatro forças da natureza. Assim, com a ponta para cima invocamos aos que obedecem a ordem cósmica e invertida, com a cabeça indo para o abismo invocam-se ou evocam-se aqueles que atuam contra a ordem pré-estabelecida no momento da criação.
SITAEL é o mais alto signatário que tem o poder de pôr fim às adversidades por estar ligado ao construtor das Leis. Se fosse possível comparar a força entre o criador e a criatura diríamos que é uma relação entre a chama de um palito de fósforo e o maior dos sois. Absolutamente nada pode se opor a ordem cósmica sob pena de sua própria destruição a medida em que se afasta das Leis que o criou em uma relação de causa e efeito.
Concluímos aqui que o adverso é o resultado do que contraria as leis cósmicas sejam em construções internas como nossa alma, evolução psíquica como em nosso exterior. A carência de harmonia com os mundos superiores. SITAEL se encarregara então de reestabelecer a harmonia perdida estabelecendo em nós a vontade e a capacidade construtora que antes atuava em sentido inverso, descendente, e agora para o modo reto, ascendente, corretamente, deixaremos assim de tropeçar com as adversidades. Não é por acaso que em seu Salmo afirma “que não permitirá que os seus pés tropecem em uma pedra”.
SITAEL é ainda o fiel da balança, um grande mediador de conflitos, um pacificador capaz de unir inimigos e dissolver situações de enfrentamento já que sendo fiel aos ditames da consciência proporciona a união de Kether-Binah (vontade do regramento primeiro) que desagua na superação das adversidades com a sabedoria do caminho de Hochmah.
1.7.3    Proteção contra as armas, animais ferozes, as influências das forças do mal.
Na terminologia esotérica as bestas ferozes referem-se aos operários do abismo que recebem as nossas energias desperdiçadas com as paixões para a construção do mundo ao revés.
Ocorre que a partir de Malkuth até Kether, na via ascendente, contamos com nove escalas, nove níveis até se chegar a Kether. Ao virarmos a arvore ao contrário teremos também as mesmas escalas só que agora descendentes. Cabalisticamente falando são chamadas de cascas da arvore por tratar-se de energias degradadas enquanto as primeiras são consideradas o cerne. No livro de Dante Alighieri intitulado a Divina Comédia podemos ter uma ideia de como estas zonas se desenvolvem. Há que saber ler com o entendimento de um cabalista.
Desta forma observamos que quanto mais elevada é a fonte da energia maiores serão os abismos em que esta mergulha e maiores serão as consequências que o indivíduo deve sofrer.
No processo evolutivo espiritual esotérico afirma-se que quando o indivíduo pretende subir de forma consciente e voluntária é mergulhado no abismo em zonas opostas a que pretende ingressar – a lei da dualidade, algo como um efeito estilingue. Consta ainda que alguns indivíduos ingressaram no mal conscientemente em zonas muito baixas na ânsia de subir, mas não o fizeram no intuito de vencer a sí mesmo, mas pelo poder, transgredindo as Leis, fazendo o mal, o que os levou ao seu aprisionamento as baixas esferas. Devemos vencer nossos próprios infernos. Afirmam as escrituras que o Kabir Jesus antes de subir ao Pai desceu por três dias.
Como estamos tratando das rodas de SITAEL nos referimos as energias de Kether-Binah, isto porque os Gênios que formam o primeiro coro angélico, os Serafins, pertencem a esfera de Kether que são responsáveis pela edificação do mundo material a nível de Vontade. Para entendermos estes efeitos basta atentarmos os impactos que um equívoco, uma decisão errada por parte de um chefe de governo, uns diretores gerais de uma grande empresa podem causar a uma sociedade, um grupo grande de pessoas. Impacto este muito maior do que o causado por alguém que não possua grandes responsabilidades como um operário.
O lado negativo de SITAEL está ligado a Belial que segundo a cabala possui legiões conhecidos como Vasos de Iniquidade, Vasos de Ira, Vasos de Morte, de Fúria, de Cólera, de Crime e Corrupção. Estas bestas que se encontram em nossos abismos internos e utilizam as armas que vingam as mortes que sua dinâmica produz.
SITAEL nos protege destas almas e destes animais ferozes desde nosso interior. Não se trata simplesmente de invocar o Gênio para nos tirar do destino que temos gerado. Um preceito esotérico afirma que quando um karma iniciou sua dinâmica não há mais o que fazer. SITAEL nos faz voltar atrás em nossas atitudes e abrir um espaço para a entrada das energias superiores a fim de que não voltemos a atuar ao revés. E é claro que uma mudança interna precede a exterior e os rigores do destino são desviados pelos obreiros de SITAEL lembrando que SITAEL também é um título e que cada Gênio tem a sua disposição uma legião de nomes que trabalham em seu nome.
Trabalham no sentido de eliminar a vingança que temos suscitado pelas vias da esfera do perdão que transforma a energia degradada diluindo-a em luz.
Cumpre entender que as energias de Binah estando ligados diretamente as Leis e a relação de causa e efeito, o karma, pode facilmente transformar o que seria justiça em sua contraparte negativa intitulada vingança.
Outros Gênios que tratam de eliminar as forças do mal.
1->3 SITAEL: Proteção contra as armas e forças do mal, magia negra – restabelece a justiça;
3->4 NELKHAEL: Contra as bruxarias; pela consciência do “não poder” do outro;
4->6 REIYEL: Livrar-se de bruxos, encantos e sortilégios pelo “peso na consciência”;
9->2 DAMABIAH: Transforma o mal em bem, atua contra a magia negra nos elevando espiritualmente.
Outros gênios que ajudam a combater os animais ferozes:
1->3 SITAEL: Protege contra os animais ferozes;
5->7 HAAMIAH: Protege contra os animais ferozes, espíritos infernais, habitantes do abismo;
8->9 MEHIEL: Nos vacina contra os habitantes do abismo, a maledicência, imagens negativas.
1.7.4    Para ser fiel a palavra dada e não fugir dos compromissos.
Tradução comum e corrente
“João 1:1-5: No princípio era o verbo, e o verbo estava com[junto de] Deus, e Deus era o verbo. [a palavra].
Este estava no princípio junto de Deus.
Todas as coisas foram feitas via [Gr. di’a: por meio de, para, ou por causa de] ele, e sem ele [Gr. choris autos: sem relação a ele] nada do que foi feito se fez. [sem relação a ele não se fez coisa nenhuma do que foi feito].
Nele, estava a vida e a vida era a luz dos homens;
e a luz resplandece nas trevas, e as trevas não a alcançou.[Gr. Katelaben]. ”
São muitos os exoteristas que estão à procura da palavra perdida, mas não sabem o que procuram. Várias escolas afirmam que tem a palavra que dá o poder e faz todos os milagres, abrir as portas dos templos. Uma vez por ano um sacerdote pronuncia a palavra sagrada que trará um ano esplendoroso e o que temos, guerra, sofrimentos etc.
A questão, porém, é que pode se estar de posse do mantra mais poderoso do universo, mas se antes não houvermos encarnado a palavra, o verbo, nada ocorrera.
A palavra sagrada não pode ser pronunciada senão aquele que a encarnou – assim afirma o conhecimento secreto.
As sagradas escrituras afirmam que no princípio era o verbo e que o verbo criou tudo o que existe, que trouxe luz as trevas.
Toda criação vem pelo verbo, pela frequência, tudo é frequência, ondas. Nossa laringe emite ondas. O ser humano possui uma capacidade infinita de produzir estas variedades de modulações. Todos os objetos existentes têm sua frequência. Hoje já temos aparelhos que conseguem ler as ondas do cérebro, coração etc. E, também, em plantas, no interior da terra e do espaço.
A mentira que existe aqui no mundo físico já não pode ser nos mundos superiores já que lá verbalizar é criar. As ondas não têm a estabilidade deste mundo, não podem ser estéreis. Vale lembrar que a criação vem de cima para baixo e o que foi criado em cima está destinado a materializar-se em baixo.
Para um mago a palavra é um instrumento sagrado que pode dar ou tirar a vida, assim não faz sentido um mago mentiroso, que descumpra a palavra dada, já que a mentira é estéril. Para um iniciado a mentira tem um preço a mais do que para os ignorantes, eis que mesmo com um justo motivo pode acarretar no enfraquecimento de seu verbo, o que poderia ser desastroso para a “arte”.
De outro lado alguém em seu juízo perfeito e na ausência da ignorância não importunaria um mago que embora trabalhe sobre si, em um escorregão, com seu verbo pode causar grande dano.
Lembremos quando O Kabir Jesus ressuscitou Lázaro. Uma vontade e um verbo forte podem trazer de volta quem ainda não foi definitivamente. Conhecemos o caso de uma mãe que ordenou a volta de uma filha que os médicos já a deram por falecida – um milagre?…
Aquele que encarnou a palavra é capaz dá-la, fazê-la cumprir e cobrar de quem lhe deu. A palavra dada por um mago ou a ele dada é como um contrato assinado com sangue que compromete a própria alma.
Encarnar a palavra é uma questão de energia e, também, uma disciplina. Deve-se amar a verdade em primeiro lugar, reconhecê-la sem véus, manter a palavra dada e, só com sua presença já servirá a quem o necessite eis que fara com que as coisas dadas por acordo se cumpram.
Quando se está no mundo de Binah a palavra é de fundamental importância. Seja porque tudo é Lei, causa e efeito ou mesmo porque podemos negociar nosso karma junto aos senhores da Lei.
No mundo esotérico conhecemos o Tribunal do Karma composto por Anúbis e seus 42 Juízes da Lei, que cuidam das 48 leis do mundo físico relacionados aos nossos cromossomos. Assim como há um Anúbis particular que compõe as partes de nosso Ser e que aplica a Lei do Karma em nós mesmos, há também o Anúbis macrocósmicos e o Universal que administra os multiversos.
Cada Juiz é responsável por um tipo de delito da ordem cósmica. Não há tribunal de apelação, este e o último julgamento que passamos depois dos três internos após a partida deste mundo.
Já tive a oportunidade de levar aos Senhores da Lei indivíduos que faziam grande mal ao próximo, a fim de que chamando o karma emergente em razão de seus atos e, bloqueando a misericórdia um dano maior fosse evitado ou minimizado. O raio kármico começa a descer quando os Senhores da Lei deferem o pedido e pronunciam sua sentença.
Quando um grande número de pessoas está sendo prejudicadas, a energia vital desta gente, emanada em razão de seu sofrimento, pode ser utilizada como excelente testemunho ante o Archote do Karma.
Diferentemente dos tribunais terrenos a sentença é objetiva e imediata eis que se trata de somatórios resultantes da operação da balança que tem como medida a Lei cósmica e como peso as nossas ações sob a ponta do fiel.
Convém tomarmos cuidado ao solicitar algo junto aos Jerarcas da Lei, principalmente se fazemos parte da questão, em razão de que, não existe pessoalidade nos mundos superiores e a sentença pode não ser a que esperamos.

Determinados indivíduos por sua evolução conseguem se desvencilhar de algumas Leis do Universo. Sua consciência vibra em níveis mais acima, tais como iniciados, profetas, mestres, etc. Ocorre quando se desviam da Grande Obra ou infringem as Leis. O esoterismo destaca o caso d o Arcanjo Sakaki, do Arqui-Físico-Químico-Cósmico-Comum Arcanjo Looisos etc.
– Dharma                   Recompensa por boas obras
Mas em nossa existência podemos negociar algumas coisas mediante acordo. Não se trata de acordos de leniência como os que são feitos em nosso mundo ao lado de advogados mal-intencionados, mas sim, relativos à nossa evolução, mas, com o selo da palavra dada.
Podemos levar ante Anúbis aqueles que nos fazem mal e fazem mal ao próximo, que cometem crimes contra a humanidade e como afirmamos não há apelação nem magia negra que salve quem cair neste juízo pois está em uma esfera muito alta próximo e da criação. A Justiça pode vir como uma espada que vem do alto e que penetra lentamente a medida que descende dos mundos de cima.
Formas de pagar o Karma:
1 – Com Dharma ou Capital Cósmico (que fomos acumulando nas existências)
2 – Com Dor Negociável (pode ser negociada se sabemos como)
3 – Com Dor Não Negociável (delitos contra o Espírito Santo)
4 – Com Caridade (ao Leão da Lei se domina com a Caridade, ajudando aos demais)
5 – Com Negócios Objetivos com a Lei (comprometendo-nos, trabalhos a realizar)
Os juramentos têm relação direta com o mundo de Binah e não é por acaso que ainda são aceitos inclusive em tribunais da terra. Jurar ante um tribunal terreno é jurar perante o tribunal espiritual. Há que considerar aqueles que mentem, mas acreditam estar falando a verdade.
Da rigidez de Binah, de suas leis, houve um momento na evolução humana (e também haverá em nossa evolução interna) que se deu quando da vinda da energia Crística ao nosso plano e instituiu a graça do qual falaremos mais adiante, mas que não se trata de uma aceitação abstrata para perdão de todo porvir de iniquidades, crimes praticados, uma carta aberta a delinquência sem punição.
Haverá então um momento em que precisaremos nos liberar da energia de SITAEL para encarnar a energia Crística a fim de liberarmos do karma. Quem deseja a graça deve lembrar-se do preço pago pelo retentor.
E que preço é este?
Há iniciações que ocorrem no mundo físico e outras nos mundos internos. No mundo físico ocorre uma catarse que se configura em um projeto de intenções e uma instrução sobre o caminho adiante – é claro que o verbo utilizado em um ritual tem seu valor já que uma vontade é referendada pelo ato e pode até haver sentimentos durante as formalidades.
A INICIAÇÃO:
Nos mundos internos certa vez fui informado que era muito valioso e que não teria mestre no mundo físico. Ri comigo mesmo e como não me considero uma pessoa muito simpática pensei comigo: “que bom que alguém me acha valioso.”
Vários mestres formaram uma roda em minha volta enquanto um Ser, de pouca estatura, que parecia uma mistura de mestre dos magos com tartaruga ninja estava flutuando a poucos metros.
Comecei a levitar gostosamente com a sensação de leveza e a mente zazonava como se tivesse cheirado éter ou tomado uma injeção para fazer uma endoscopia.
Por um instante perdi a consciência e quando voltei percebi que os mestres estavam se retirando na direção oposta à da roda. Os instantes de inconsciência no plano referente referem-se a fatos ocorridos a nível do Ser.
Exclamei ao Mestre algo como: Recebi o poder, mas tudo parece igual, sinto que falta alguma coisa.
Então me foi mostrado uma cena do Cristo, e embora não a tenha trazido ao mundo físico, me deixou aterrorizado (isso veio) e exclamei: Você está maluco, como vou fazer isto?
Então posso afirmar que o preço da graça é a vivência do drama Crístico cuja instrução é: Nega-te a ti mesmo, toma tua cruz e siga-me.
Outros Gênios trabalham pelo cumprimento da palavra dada, assim em resumo temos:
1-3 SITAEL Ser fiel a palavra por ser exigência de leis superiores, irrefutáveis;
2-2 HAZIEL Execução de uma promessa feita atuando de forma circunstancial;
2->9 HEKAMIAH: Cumprimento da palavra dada pela lealdade;
3->4 NELKHAEL: Cumprimento da palavra dada pela força da conscientização.
1.7.5    Proteção contra as tendências hipócritas, contra a ingratidão e o perjúrio.
O lado negativo da força
Refere-se a hipocrisia, a ingratidão ao perjúrio. A pessoa ao invés de evitar o problema irá cria-lo. Não é confiável e somente com a adversidade será capaz de compreender seus erros.
Refere-se àquela frase: “o fim justifica os meios” não importando que suas atitudes sejam verdadeiras, de acordo com as Leis superiores. Quem não mantem sua palavra não pode fazer construções firmes, já que a mentira é um “não ser” e com o tempo a falta de nobreza transparece, torna-se notória.
Como tem por base a mentira não há méritos a serem reconhecidos e se algo sobrar estará contaminado, como na estória do menino e o lobo de Monteiro Lobato.
SITAEL aqui procura mostrar a necessidade de respeito as normas cósmicas e pode o fazer pelo ensinamento ou pelo karma.
Abro aqui uns parênteses para tratar do brocardo Maquiavélico que reza: “os fins justificam os meios”. Em minha monografia intitulada Razoabilidade: O princípio. Aspectos estruturais, trato da questão e defendo que os fins podem justificar os meios apenas para evitar um mal maior eminente e inevitável – dos males o menor -, por referir-se a um ato de bondade que está ligado a Hochmah é superior a Binah, sendo assim uma exceção filantrópica e não uma regra para usos egoísticos.
1.8        Escrituras
S 91:1 (90-1) “Dicens Domino spes mea et fortitudo mea Deus meus confidam in eum.
“Direi ao Eterno: Tu és o meu refúgio, a minha fortaleza. O! Meu Deus, em quem confio!”
1.9        Orações:
SITAEL, permita-me, Senhor, reconhecer, aos que foram no passado meus irmãos
e os que foram meus adversários e inimigos,
aos que amei e os que odiei para criarmos juntos uma nova esperança.
Situa-me, SITAEL, no coração do conflito, no olho do furacão
para que teu Amor derramado em minha imaginação
atue como um solvente que dissipe os enfrentamentos e as tempestades.
SITAEL, faz de mim um homem fiel para com os de cima
e igualmente fiel para com os de baixo.
Faz que Eu seja o homem equilibrado e justo
em todas as posições enfrentadas
e não permita que caia na tentação de estar ao lado de uns e de outros.
Em todo o momento e em todo o lugar,
permita-me Senhor SITAEL, ser um portador de esperanças.
1.10    Exortação:
Deveis aprender com vossos adversários.
Neles encontrarás sempre os mais adequados Mestres.
Eles lhes dirão sem contemplações quais são as vossas lacunas,
as vossas falhas lhes dirão se tens sido imprudente, presunçoso ou temerário.
Neles não encontrarás nem dubiedade e nem hipocrisia,
a verdade pura se expressará por seus lábios.
Sabereis como sois na parte obscura de vossa esfera,
ali onde não reluz qualquer resplendor de consciência.
Os inimigos, os adversários, são aqueles que os amam com amor desinteressado.
Não levanteis vossa mão contra eles, pois quando desapareçam,
já não podereis ver o espelho que reflete vossos erros.
Cristo disse: “ama o inimigo” e Eu vos digo agora:
Conserve-o, respeite-o, utilize suas virtudes!
Teu inimigo te há sido dado
para que possas expulsar de teu interior
esse conglomerado de coisas detestáveis que ele expressa.
Contempla hoje mesmo, peregrino, os defeitos de teu inimigo
e extirpa-os sem mais tardar de teu próprio ser
porque estão muito vivos dentro de ti, ainda que passes toda a vida os negando.
Oração e exortação de Kabaleb.

Juramento do Bacharel em Direito "JURO, COMO BACHAREL EM DIREITO, NO EXERCÍCIO DAS MINHAS FUNÇÕES E DO MEU OFÍCIO, RESPEITAR OS PRINCÍPIOS SOBRE OS QUAIS SE ASSENTAM AS LEIS, GUIAR-ME À LUZ DA ÉTICA, SEMPRE EM BUSCA DA JUSTIÇA, E DOS VALORES HUMANOS, VALENDO-ME DO DIREITO COMO INSTRUMENTO MÁXIMO PARA ASSEGURAR AOS HOMENS OS SEUS DIREITOS FUNDAMENTAIS E INTOCÁVEIS, SEM DISTINÇÃO DE QUALQUER NATUREZA.  E, ACIMA DE TUDO DEFENDER A LIBERDADE, POIS SEM ELA NÃO HÁ DIREITO QUE SOBREVIVA, NEM PAZ QUE SE CONCRETIZE."!

“Posso nao concordar com o que você faz, mas lutarei até a morte pelo seu direito de continuar fazendo.”  Voltaire
Como entrar com ações contra o exame de ordem da OAB? Não há como sustentar a exclusão de +++ 4 MILHÕES +++ de bacharéis de direito que estão fora do mercado de trabalho em virtude do corporativismo, de uma confraria e da reserva de mercado. Este número é absurdo e só tende a aumentar. Para tudo explodir é uma questão de tempo… Milhares de bacharéis estão entrando com as ações.
Na barra a direita e acima possuimos uma Categoria completa, com materiais relativo aos exames de ordem - Decisões - Modelos de petições - Projetos de Lei - e muita matéria do que vem ocorrendo DIVULGUE este material...
Quem sai prejudicado? R. A população mais carente que não pode ter acesso a justiça em virtude do auto custo de um advogado...
Quem defende este exame? R. -> A OAB, advogados que terão que dividir o pão com mais de 4 MILHÕES de Bacharéis que se tornarão Advogados...
Eles lutarão até o último suspiro para que isto não ocorra, mas nos continuaremos lutando quando não houver mais suspiro...

1.2        Palavras chaves:
DISCRIÇÃO, expressão velada, TRABALHOS OCULTOS, industrialidade, DESCOBRIMENTOS ÚTEIS, acidentes, VIAGEM MARÍTIMA, tranquilidade para atormentados (cabeça-coração, fogo-agua) DEPRESSÃO, revela os traidores SUCESSO PROFISSIONAL.
(-) CONTRATEMPOS, descobrimentos perigosos destrutivos, CRISE EMPRESARIAL.
1.3        Movimentação Sephiroth: As na quarta posição
Considerando que Hesed é o primeiro de seu Mundo e o resultado das forças, o segundo “He” fórmula: יהוה – “Yod-He-Vô-He”, portanto o final de um ciclo e ao mesmo tempo a semente de um novo, podemos afirmar que o “As” se encontra em sua sede.
Nos deparamos, então, com a semente, fruto de um ciclo, que se resume na tomada de uma consciência que mira para algo novo com origem na Vontade primordial que descende do abstrato para a construção do paraíso terrenal, já que o segundo “He” tem relação com o elemento Terra.
Há que considerar, aqui, que a construção produzida anteriormente por Binah refere-se a um ponto muito alto, mais afastado da matéria, ligado, portanto, a interiorização; de modo que o êxito proposto será a nível interno, sobre si mesmo, como a satisfação, o prestígio, reconhecimentos sociais, triunfos amorosos, enfim tudo que se relacione a prosperidade e o bem-estar social.
Esta força transmite a redenção, opulência e felicidade.
1.4        Arcano – Mundo: Quatro de paus no mundo de Atziluth.
Recebe o título de Senhor da Obra Perfeita. Refere-se ao elemento Fogo e astrologicamente corresponde a posição de Júpiter transitando pelo primeiro decanato de Leão onde manifesta seus fluxos mediante as roupagens deste signo e sob as pulsações do regente deste decanato que é o Júpiter.
Neste ponto, Kether o primeiro ponto de partida na Arvore e no zodíaco, o centro produtor de iniciativas, a essência divina, expressa-se por intermédio de Hesed, o poder espiritual realizador das bondades. No mais, o resultado desta alquimia se exteriorizara ainda pelo tom prismático de Geburah, o coordenador deste subciclo evolutivo.
Hesed leva a perfeição as últimas consequências, o esplendor que tudo toca. Não se trata de algo novo que precise passar pelas quatro fases de evolução “Yod-He-Vô-He”, senão de algo que já está pronto e em fase de acabamento final onde o objetivo é deixar sua marca, sua impressão. Basta lembrar que Hesed é o segundo “He” desta evolução.
Quanto o quatro de paus se manifesta no em Atziluth o faz no mundo das emanações, onde a Vontade Ketheriana ainda é muito forte e já a concretiza em si por estar presente no início de um segundo ciclo como gérmen resultado e também como semente dessa Vontade.

1.6        Descrição Sephiroth:
ELEMIAH é o quarto da 1ª ordem de anjos denominado como Coro dos Serafins, situa-se na morada filosofal de número 4, rege o subsendeiro que une Kether a Hesed em sua trajetória de ida ou descenso pela árvore e zodíaco. Corresponde ao santo nome de Deus Allah, segundo o idioma dos árabes. Trata das forças de Kether o primeiro ponto de partida na Arvore e no zodíaco, o centro produtor de iniciativas, a essência divina e, neste ponto, manifesta seus fluxos mediante as pulsações de Hesed, que expressa o Poder Divino, centro do qual emana todo o poder, o realizador das bondades; “Yod” do Mundo de Atziluth sobre o “Yod” do Mundo de Briah, Fogo do Fogo atuando sobre o Fogo da Água. Nesta casa nos deparamos com a essência filosofal chamada PODER DIVINO, o conjunto de qualidades, propriedades e atributos relativos ao resultado, o fruto, da união feita por Binah entre Kether e Hochmah, portanto o 2º “He” do mundo das emanações. Refere-se ao fruto encerrado na semente divina e contenedora das abundantes sementes da espiritualidade. Trata-se de uma força de Vontade poderosa, que impulsiona uma realização plena do poder. Este processo faculta nossa divindade interna a comunicar-se conosco de forma velada assim como as sementes mantem-se ocultas dentro da fruta e que não aparecem à primeira vista, mas o fazem quando são consumidas, eis que, a força de Kether provem do mundo das emanações e quando se expressem em Hesed o fazem como semente dentro de um fruto, portanto de modo oculto. As sementes carregam em si o gérmen da primeira ancestral, guardam em si a imagem e semelhança de seu Real Ser, gerando infinitas plantas iguais ao protótipo primeiro. Estas forças nos auxiliam a realizar um trabalho oculto para que nossa espiritualidade possa emergir sem oposições tal como fizera Jesus a fugir para o Egito quando estava sob a ameaça de Herodes. Daí vem o atributo, esta qualidade imbuída de poder denominada Deus oculto.
Quando esta força é ativada à vontade se fará poderosa, se realizará plenamente, trata-se, pois, de um ponto exitoso de manifestações felizes e satisfatória. Os atos serão nobres e magnânimos. Abrem-se as portas para as recompensas.
Hesed referre-se ao 2º “He” do mundo das emanações, mas também é o “Yod” do segundo triangulo conhecido como Ético e o “He” do topo do pilar da misericórdia estando logo abaixo de Hochmah que é o “Yod” da referida coluna.
Estas essências encerradas em nosso interior guardam nossa verdadeira identidade e olhando internamente seremos capazes de reparar os muitos erros cometidos no caminho e que nos afastam da imagem original.
Se a força de nosso Pai interno for forte o suficiente de forma a impor sua manifestação por meio de seus impulsos, e se formos voluntariosos em relação a nosso Real Ser, este poderá decretar o fim do erro, dando um basta, e nossa vida passará a seguir segundo os critérios superiores que temos na genética de nosso interior espiritual.
Como já percebemos ELEMIAH nos ajuda a realizar um trabalho oculto a fim de que nossos trabalhos internos possam emergir sem oposição. O que vale para o nosso interior vale também para o externo. Eis que com a ajuda deste Gênio um trabalho que precisa ser desenvolvido em segredo a fim de que não seja prejudicado estando em seu estado embrionário crescerá em segurança como ocorreu com o Grande Kabir.
Outros Gênios trabalham sobre a discrição:
1->4 ELEMIAH: Discrição para não chamar a atenção sobre nossas obras, trabalho oculto para crescer a sombra de uma ameaça;
2->5 HAHAIAH: Discrição sobre o que estamos fazendo;
6->7 ARIEL: Discrição para não chamar a atenção sobre nossas obras.
1.7       Das virtudes concedidas:
1.7.1         Para evitar as crises de uma empresa e ter sucesso na profissão.
As pessoas regidas por este Gênio são tidas como industriosas, engenhosas, felizes em suas empresas.
A questão de ser industriosa tem a ver com a alquimia. Nos tratados alquímicos a idade média vemos sempre a fórmula: “separar o sutil do espesso com grande indústria”.
De um lado temos uma conotação psicologica que trata de analisar as distintas tendências internas a fim de que atuem para aquilo que foram criadas. De outro lado há uma conotação de trabalhos alquímicos entre homem e mulher em ato sexual a fim de elevarem-se espiritualmente.
No primeiro caso devemos observar a inteligência por traz do funcionamento de cada máquina e entre as mais conhecidas podemos destacar o relógio mecânico. Analisemos como uma peça atua sobre a outra (de modo sincrônico e harmônico) para formar uma unidade de desígnio em um coletivo de individualidades. Tudo sob a direção de uma mente, com aspectos universais, que com sua técnica encadeou todos as peças em procedimentos coligados na elaboração do produto.
Do mesmo modo ELEMIAH orientará a utilização das forças internas com a precisão de uma máquina, de um relógio para elaborar seu universo interior. Quando tudo esteja, internamente, funcionando de forma organizada, o exterior também será conduzido a uma feliz empresa e o resultado será sempre agradável, satisfatório.
No segundo caso, o trabalho alquímico pretende fazer as aguas seminais evaporarem durante o fogo sexual, como a agua em uma chaleira sob o fogo. O objetivo é que durante o coito alquímico as energias atinjam um grau de agitação que ultrapassem a frequência física (M=E*C²) e estando em ebulição subam para outros planos passando pela coluna vertebral até a cabeça e então esta energia e despejada para o coração que distribui para todo o organismo etéreo. Consequentemente o corpo físico também se beneficiará com esta energia espiritual que vai magnetizando todo, do cume para baixo, colocando tudo em ordem, de modo que as empresas físicas se adequem a Ordem Universal e tenham sucesso.
Como a agua em uma chaleira, o fogo deve ser controlado, pois se for pouco a agua não ferve e se for muito a agua derrama. Por isto se diz: “separar o sutil do espesso com grande indústria”.
Durante a chamada Magia Sexual não se perde o sêmen. Ao derrame de sêmen dá-se o nome de fornicação. Para auxiliar neste processo, pode-se utilizar a posição do Cristo crucificado, com as perdas direita sobre a esquerda apertando-se os glúteos e a cada respiração, pronuncia-se uma das letras do mantra do apóstolo João a saber: iiiiiiiiiii, aaaaaaaaaa, oooooooooo.
O mantra iiiiiiiii, ativa as energias pois está ligada a cabeça, a Vontade, ao chacra Sahásrara (igreja de Laodicéia), a coroa de espinhos colocada sobre Jesus, os múltiplos raios de luz na cabeça de Buda;
O mantra aaaaaaaaaa, corresponde ao chacra Vishudda (Igreja de Sárdis) que se refere a laringe criadora, faz as energias subirem pela medula e vibrarem no cérebro e por fim:
O mantra oooooooooo, corresponde ao chacra cardíaco, Anahát (Igreja de Tiatira, Cárdias) que distribui a energia enviada para o coração fazendo-a circular para todo o corpo pelos vasos etéricos e centros de energia.
Ao final da prática, deita-se em decúbito dorsal, utiliza-se o mantra Ham-Sá para elevar as energias que ainda estejam nas glândulas. Ao inspirar utiliza-se o mantra Ham e em uma expiração rápida como um espirro utiliza-se o mantra “Sá”.
Se observarmos o filme Anjos e Demónios – Dan Brown, em determinado momento, num relancem veremos que uma sociedade secreta, herdeiros de Jesus, praticavam um tipo de rito ligado a magia sexual.
Para se conseguir realizar esta prática necessita-se de muita disciplina e força de Vontade. Esta atividade é conhecida como Sahaja Maithuna, tantrismo branco etc. Trata-se do maior segredo da espiritualidade já revelado, a verdadeira pedra filosofal dos alquimistas. É uma prática difícil e são muitos os que á criticam não pela prática em si, mas pelos poderes prometidos acrescidos a incapacidade em realizá-los. Aqui está a chave da iniciação aos mistérios maiores aos quais não é possível de outra maneira. É um verdadeiro suplício de tântalo cujo troféu é dado somente a uns poucos. Fala-se que a cada 1 Bilhão de pessoas, apenas uma consiga.
“De mil que me buscam um me encontra, de mil que me encontram um me segue, de mil que me seguem um é meu.”
Outros gênios que tratam da pedra filosofal:
1->4 ELEMIAH: nos fornece a Vontade Poderosa para realização da alquimia.
1->5 MAHASIAH: Retificação da obra VITRIOL.
7->4 HAHASIAH: Pedra filosofal, verdade primeira para cura.
ELEMIAH influência sobre os descobrimentos uteis. Estamos fazendo a passagem do Fogo pela Agua. Oras se o Fogo tem que passar pela agua certamente que um descobrimento útil será o que proporcionará a viagem e, no caso, o mais apropriado seria um barco já que este impede que os elementos entrem em contato direto.
Como é em cima o é embaixo e como é no externo igualmente o é no interno. Assim, o descobrimento útil interno será um barco psíquico que nos leve a um porto seguro para que a espiritualidade (Fogo – Vontade) interna possa viajar pelo elemento líquido (Água – sentimentos) que é seu elemento mortal.
A construção deste barco deverá ser feita com materiais mais leves do que a Agua, material este que manterá o fogo e a agua separados, mas que permitam caminhar conjuntamente.
Contudo, devemos lembrar que a ideia central é separar o Fogo da Água.
Lembremos que Hesed é o produto da união de Kether e Hochmah por intermédio de Binah. A ideia produzida pela atividade de Binah que é a força intermediária graças ao qual a agua e o fogo podem trabalhar juntas.
Vemos assim que o descobrimento útil é aquele graças ao qual o fogo e a agua se conciliam.
No plano físico dar-se a origens aos inventos de toda a espécie que nos ajudam no dia a dia, facilitam os trabalhos, conciliam coisas opostas e que a exemplo podem ir desde um descascador de legumes ou fruta, um canivete multitarefas que facilite os trabalhos da dona de casa até para além de um dispositivo de transmissão que exija menos de quem está dirigindo, pilotando ou ainda uma composição que combine duas substâncias opostas.
Outros Gênios que conciliam o fogo com a água:
1->4 ELEMIAH: Hesed de Kether – é o 1º “He” do “Yod” Kether;
2->6 IEZALEL: Tiphereth de Hochmah é o 2º “He” do “Yod” Hochmah;
3->7 YEIAIEL: Netzah de Binah – Netzah é o 2 “He” do “Yod” Binah;
4->8 LECABEL: Hod de Hesed – Hod é o 2º “He” do “Yod” Hesed;
5->9 IEIAZEL: Yesod de Geburah – Yesod e o 2º “He” do “Yod” Geburah;
7->2 VEHUEL: Hochmah de Netzah – Netzah e o 2º “He” do “Yod” Hochmah – do 10 vai para o 1;
8->3 YEIALEL: Binah de Hod – Hod e o 2º “He” do “Yod” Binah – do 10 vai para o 1;
9->4 EYAEL: Hesed de Yesod – Yesod e o 2º “He” do “Yod” Hesed – do 10 vai para o 1.
1.7.2         Proteção nas viagens marítimas para e evitar acidentes.
Os nascidos sob esta égide são apaixonados por viagens. Esta paixão refere-se ao empenho em levar a mensagem do Real Ser até os domínios de Malkuth, o mundo material fazendo com nos ponhamos a serviço de nosso Deus interno, nosso Pai (nas palavras do Kabir Jesus).
Deste impulso nasce em nós o desejo externo, as habilidades por viagens, por criar máquinas.
Se não compreendermos as movimentações psicológicas que ocorrem em nosso foro interno, provavelmente ocorrerá que se veja impulsionado a viajar buscando fora as respostas que deveriam ser escavadas do interior.
Viajar com segurança pelo mar traduz-se em viajar pelas aguas emocionais em um barco a vela com bons ventos. Ou se a tempestade vier que o barco seja forte e esteja firme na turbulência. Lembremos aqui que Briah refere-se ao mundo das emoções, emoções estas que superam a racionalidade por estar em um plano superior e por serem mais antigas na ordem da criação.
No mundo físico implica um equilíbrio e proteção diante das situações difíceis e segurança nas viagens por mar.
Me vem à mente neste momento, a canção abaixo, inspirada por ELEMIAH. Observe que que carrega as forças de Kether e de Hesed; Segura Na Mão de Deus, geralmente cantada pelo Padre Marcelo Rossi, nos dá uma ideia das atividades deste Anjo.
Se as águas do mar da vida quiserem te afogar
Segura na mão de Deus e vai
Se as tristezas desta vida quiserem te sufocar
Segura na mão de Deus e vai
Segura na mão de Deus, segura na mão de Deus
Pois ela, ela te sustentará
Não temas, segue adiante e não olhes para trás
Segura na mão de Deus e vai
Se a jornada é pesada e te cansas da caminhada
Segura na mão de Deus e vai
Orando, jejuando, confiando e confessando
Segura na mão de Deus e vai
O Espírito do Senhor sempre te revestirá
Segura na mão de Deus e vai
Jesus Cristo prometeu que jamais te deixará
Segura na mão de Deus e vai
Outros Gênios trabalham sobre a viagens:
1->4 ELEMIAH: Evitar acidentes. Proteção nas viagens marítimas;
3->7 YEIAIEL: Proteção nas viagens por mar a nos naufrágios (morais e físicos);
3->8 MELAHEL: Deus que libera dos males. Viagem com segurança – Binah conduz Hod;
6->3 MIKAEL: Segurança nas viagens da vida e para os diplomáticos;
6->5 YLAHIAH: Viagens com a finalidade de instrução;
7->5 IMAMIAH: Proteção nas viagens que passam de uma terra a outra, deslocamentos emocionais;
8->6 UMABEL: Para que as viagens sejam agradáveis e proveitosas;
9->2 DAMABIAH: Proteção para viagens e explorações marítimas.
1.7.3         Tranquilidade de espírito para as pessoas atormentadas.
Hesed é o segundo “He” do mundo das emanações – Atziluth, já que resultou da união de Binah entre Kether e Hochmah, sendo ainda o “Yod” do mundo das criações de Briah, ou seja, do mundo da agua, das emoções.
Isto significa que as cargas das emoções deverão ser conduzidas pela agua, ou seja, por meio de nossos sentimentos a fim de que este poder chegue um dia a Malkuth, ao plano terrestre, produzindo assim, um ato material.
Uma carga de fogo deve baixar a água, i.e., as energias de Atziluth, da Vontade de Kether precisam da emoção para descer. Combinar o fogo com a água não é tarefa fácil já que são elementos antagônicos.
Os contados com estes elementos contraditórios naturalmente produzirão tormentos.
Na dinâmica deste tormento nossos sentimentos recebem um impulso energético que vitaliza os impulsos, os desperta e com a força deste sentimento se lançam com veemência a realização da Vontade. Os desejos nos fazem dar muitas voltas antes de alcançarmos o nosso objetivo.
Então temos uma vontade potencializada e posteriormente enclausurada na obrigação de seguir as regras. Fisicamente temos uma dicotomia entre cabeça coração. O coração diz: pode fazer. A cabeça afirma: Não deves. Então o tormento se resolverá de duas formas: Saltando-se a barreira do dever (cabeça) transgredindo-se a regra ou reprimindo-se o desejo (coração) deixando que se retorça em sua insatisfação.
ELEMIAH auxilia a aplacar os tormentos da alma mais conhecido como depressão dando a consciência do que está produzindo o desassossego, desta luta entre a espiritualidade e as emoções. Nos revela as tendências emotivas que pretendem trair nosso desígnio espiritual de forma que possamos combatê-las.
Conhecer a natureza do mal equivale a liquidá-lo. As pessoas e principalmente os médicos com este Gênio em seu horoscopo possuem uma habilidade especial para tratar desta doença.
São as tendências, os egos, que se opõe aos desígnios a Vontade-fogo de nosso Real Ser, que pertencem ao elemento Agua, um elemento passivo, de desejos, e pretendem apagar nosso Fogo interno.
A raposa deve atravessar o rio em molar a cauda.
Quando o trabalho espiritual é executado, em sua dinâmica externa ocorre do mesmo modo e o tormento sessa.
Ao mago branco basicamente é permitido quase tudo desde que não viole as Leis cósmicas (Binah), o livre arbítrio (Kether) e não cause desnecessariamente sofrimentos a terceiros (Hochmah). Lembremos da frase Socrática:
“A liberdade de cada um termina onde começa a liberdade do outro.
Abro aqui uns parênteses para esclarecer que a realização da Vontade se faz pelos segredos constantes no nome de Deus, a fórmula mágica e oculta de YHVH (fórmula: יהוה – “Yod-He-Vô-He”.) sendo:
“Yod”, a vontade ativa que vem do interior, não confundir com o desejo – passivo;
“He”, o sentimento, a energia que irá abastecer a vontade;
“Vô”, o pensamento, a formação do que se deseja, o Arquiteto;
“He”, um ato material que puxe os outros três e também a cristalização dos mesmos.
Outros Gênios que combatem a depressão:
1->1 VEHUIAH: Concede força de vontade e movimentando a vida;
1->4 ELEMIAH: Da a consciência do que produz o desassossego;
3->2 LAUVIAH: Fornece uma visão melhor do futuro e retira a sensação de impotência. Afasta de nós os ocupantes das baixas esferas;
3->7 YEIAIEL: Desenvolvimento emotivo para vencer as tempestades e os naufrágios emocionais.
5->8 REHAEL: Depressão relativo a conflito superior-inferior, problemas com pai, autoridades;
8->3 YEIALEL: Nos concede a lógica e força mental contra os pensamentos que nos afundam;
9->3 MANAKEL: Atua sobre os sentimentos de culpa nos incutindo a imagem verdadeira;
9->9 MUMIAH: Protege contra o desespero e as tendências suicidas.
1.7.4         O conhecimento dos traidores.
A multidão de desejos internos que tornam longo e penoso o caminhar para a realização da Vontade, no exterior receberá o nome de traidor.
Esotericamente afirma-se que o Cristo teve três traidores em seu caminho a saber: Judas, Pilatos e Califas.
Judas é conhecido como o demônio do desejo já que trai o seu Mestre por 30 moedas – Traidor de Hochmah;
Caifás é o demônio da mente, o precursor das falsas doutrinas, o prevaricador, que recebe o cajado para cuidar das ovelhas, mas se aproveita delas, que transmite o conhecimento adulterado e impede que alcancemos a libertação interna – Traidor de Binah.
Pilatos é conhecido como o demônio da má Vontade, aquele que lava as mãos, está sempre encontrando desculpas para seus erros – Traidor de Kether.
Dante Oligeri afirma na Divina Comédia que a traição é o pior dos crimes e está encerrada no nono círculo, ou seja, o mais profundo abismo em uma região subdividida, mas representada pelo gelo que congela até as lágrimas, indicação da frieza da alma que se afasta do calor da luz Crística. Isto indica que o subconsciente mantem uma autotortura constante a um nível bem complicado de chagar mas que se reflete na vida cotidiana também.
Pode-se invocar ELEMIAH para saber quem são aqueles que nos atraiçoam, que nos impede de levar a cabo um grande propósito. Seus nomes serão revelados. Contudo como já temos aprendidos estes traidores são os protagonistas de tendências existentes em nosso interior que passam para o mundo físico, que se cristalizam.
Ao racionarmos contra os traidores exteriores estaremos matando os mensageiros que nos mostram o que carregamos em nosso interior. Ocorrerá que novos mensageiros serão enviados até que o interior esteja limpo.
Faz-se necessário o trabalho interno para erradicar as tendências que nos afligem. Eliminando-se os protagonistas internos, os externos também desaparecerão.
1.7.5        Para evitar contratempos e obstáculos nas empresas.
O lado negativo da força
O gênio contrário domina a má educação, as descobertas perigosas à sociedade e causa entraves a todas as empresas.
Se há uma crise instalada, contratempos, obstáculos, temos aqui um ponto de proteção contra o ataque dos inimigos, dos rivais, dos que estão armados para nos enfrentar. Aqui está o triunfo contra os inimigos, para que as armas sejam utilizadas adequadamente. Há que se fazer bom uso desta energia para que funcione corretamente. Que os objetivos sejam justos e verdadeiros, honrar compromissos assumidos sob pena de materialização ao revés e aparecerá a hipocrisia, a ingratidão, o perjúrio
Caso se utilize esta força negativamente os diretivos plasmarão a vitória que poderá vir pelas vias de procedimentos distorcido e todo o processo será submetido a esta força destrutiva ora invocada, que trata a destruição, a guerra, a degradação em todos os níveis.
Como vivemos no mundo de Malkuth onde as energias têm-se plasmado preferencialmente de forma negativa, a vitória conseguida por meio de forças degradadas irá tragando a vitória que só poderá subsistir ao preço de um esforço contínuo e fatigoso.
Um bom exemplo desta degradação energética e seu repique interno e externo pode ser vista na obra de William Shakespeare intitulada Macbeth.
Hesed-Júpiter reflete a bondade de seu pai (pela coluna da direita) Hochmah-Urano. Sendo ambos os planetas compostos de material rarefeito estampam o nosso hiperurano filosofal platónico a ideia de um mundo muito acima de nossas possibilidades cognitivas. Uma energia tão sutil é capaz de trazer grandes benefícios a uma alma que esteja em sintonia com estes mundos. De outro lado sua sutilidade aplicada a matéria cada vez mais densa cria uma tensão muito grande de destruição.
Deste modo o mal direcionamento destas forças, quando dado a quem não recebeu uma educação adequada – o aprimoramento das existências -, ao bárbaro, conduzirá a descobrimentos perigosos.
Uma boa educação visando a consciência pode evitar a criação de Frankensteins.
Estes descobrimentos internos podem levar a cada uma de nossas tendências a adquirir uma forma de manifestação que poderá ser construtiva ou bastante destrutiva. A energia utilizada ao rever ao invés de construir grandes inventos os destruirá. Será aquele que permite transformar uma usina hidrelétrica em um monte de sucata com uma bomba de dinamite por exemplo.
A construção da usina é regida por ELEMIAH e, sua destruição, com inventos altamente destrutivos pela sua contraparte abismal. Sua influência utiliza a tecnologia atómica para gerar energia que beneficiará a milhões, com toda a segurança, ou para criar uma bomba altamente destrutiva.
Do mesmo modo em nossa vida seremos capazes de destruir uma pessoa, uma empresa, um negócio, um amor, uma amizade, um conceito filosófico. O poder divino é transformado em poder diabólico.
1.8        Escrituras
“S 6:4 (6-5) Revertere YHVH erue animam meam salva me propter misericordiam tuam.
Volta-te, Senhor, livra a minha alma; salva-me em virtude de tua benignidade.”
1.9        Oração
“ELEMIAH: Deus Oculto.
ELEMIAH, Senhor que oculta o rastro na engrenagem dos negócios humanos;
Se o Teu dedo poderoso me designou para moldar o Teu barro,
protege-me, ajuda-me, não permitas que nesse jogo me desvaneça.
Se devo viver toda a minha vida sem descobrir a eterna fonte de luz,
segue meus passos ELEMIAH;
Não permitas que uma ambição desmensurada se apodere de mim;
LIVRA-ME de que um karma pesado como chumbo caia sobre meus ombros.
Quando compreenda, quando souber, quando Teu rosto oculto me seja revelado,
meu amor, como uma seta-grande, imensa irá em direção a Ti.
1.10    Exortação
Tú que constróis, tu que moldas a matéria em mil formas, estas criando eternidade.
Coloquei em ti minha confiança ao dar-te este rol;
Quis que por intermédio de ti
os homens dispusessem de uma base material que lhes permitam buscar-me.
Porém tu os atanazastes de tal maneira que não caia sobre eles o sopro,
não caia sobre eles o alento para empreender esta busca em seus interiores.
Esqueça por um momento as suas empresas, seus negócios,
seus conselhos de administração e busca minha face para reencontrar o sopro do humano,
para que possas restituir sua pureza ao marco natural que Eu criei para ti.
Acalma sua ambição, persegue objetivos humanos,
e o bosque voltará a se bosque e, o mar voltará a ser mar.
Eu pus em ti a minha confiança
para que cries um entorno humano em que o homem seja feliz,
porém para alimentar tua cobiça, tua ambição, tua vaidade,
o mundo morre e tu morreras com ele sem descobrir-me.
Desde já te chamo,
Desde aqui te estendo a mão.
Oração e exortação de Kabaleb.

Juramento do Bacharel em Direito "JURO, COMO BACHAREL EM DIREITO, NO EXERCÍCIO DAS MINHAS FUNÇÕES E DO MEU OFÍCIO, RESPEITAR OS PRINCÍPIOS SOBRE OS QUAIS SE ASSENTAM AS LEIS, GUIAR-ME À LUZ DA ÉTICA, SEMPRE EM BUSCA DA JUSTIÇA, E DOS VALORES HUMANOS, VALENDO-ME DO DIREITO COMO INSTRUMENTO MÁXIMO PARA ASSEGURAR AOS HOMENS OS SEUS DIREITOS FUNDAMENTAIS E INTOCÁVEIS, SEM DISTINÇÃO DE QUALQUER NATUREZA.  E, ACIMA DE TUDO DEFENDER A LIBERDADE, POIS SEM ELA NÃO HÁ DIREITO QUE SOBREVIVA, NEM PAZ QUE SE CONCRETIZE."!

“Posso nao concordar com o que você faz, mas lutarei até a morte pelo seu direito de continuar fazendo.”  Voltaire
Como entrar com ações contra o exame de ordem da OAB? Não há como sustentar a exclusão de +++ 4 MILHÕES +++ de bacharéis de direito que estão fora do mercado de trabalho em virtude do corporativismo, de uma confraria e da reserva de mercado. Este número é absurdo e só tende a aumentar. Para tudo explodir é uma questão de tempo… Milhares de bacharéis estão entrando com as ações.
Na barra a direita e acima possuimos uma Categoria completa, com materiais relativo aos exames de ordem - Decisões - Modelos de petições - Projetos de Lei - e muita matéria do que vem ocorrendo DIVULGUE este material...
Quem sai prejudicado? R. A população mais carente que não pode ter acesso a justiça em virtude do auto custo de um advogado...
Quem defende este exame? R. -> A OAB, advogados que terão que dividir o pão com mais de 4 MILHÕES de Bacharéis que se tornarão Advogados...
Eles lutarão até o último suspiro para que isto não ocorra, mas nos continuaremos lutando quando não houver mais suspiro...

1.2            Palavras chaves:
ANEDOTAS COTIDIANAS, RETIFICAÇÃO (do caráter, dos erros e da imagem), VITRIOL, Sahaja Maithuna, RECONCILIAÇÃO, conhecimento, EXAMES, altas ciências, transcendente, REALIZAÇÃO DE VONTADES, filosofia oculta, teosofia, MESTRE RITUAL, qualidades do corpo e da alma, BELEZA, aprender a querer, PAZ COM TODOS, reparação do dano.
(-) Ignorância, libertinagem, SITUAÇÕES DIFÍCEIS.
1.3        Movimentação Sephiroth: As na quinta posição
O Aleph primordial atuando na quinta posição estará atuando em Geburah e indicará o supremo rigor, dificuldades. A força do Ser interno atua com força a fim de que sua contraparte profana se adeque ao restabelecimento da Justiça e para tanto podem ser impostas situações de fracasso, acidentes, tropeços.
É um momento que exige estrema introspecção, tomada de consciência das realidades interiores a fim de que de modo inconsciente não venha a se impor o auto castigo, a auto reparação por meio da dor.
E como estamos tratando da posição “He” do segundo Mundo, ciclo, esta auto reparação ocorrerá pelas vias circunstanciais dramáticas, i. e., se o trabalho interno não for realizado será pelo incomodo que se formará a consciência do indivíduo.
1.4        Arcano – Mundo: Cinco de paus no mundo de Atziluth.
Recebe o título de Senhor da luta. Refere-se ao elemento Fogo e astrologicamente corresponde a posição de Marte transitando pelo segundo decanato de Leão onde manifesta seus fluxos mediante as roupagens deste signo e sob as pulsações do regente deste decanato que é o Marte.
Neste ponto, Kether o primeiro ponto de partida na Arvore e no zodíaco, o centro produtor de iniciativas, a essência divina, expressa-se por intermédio de Geburah que trata dos reajustes, da Justiça, da correção dos erros. No mais, o resultado desta alquimia se exteriorizara ainda pelo tom prismático de Tiphereth, o coordenador deste subciclo evolutivo.
Aqui as forças de Geburah mesclam-se com as forças Hesed, por intermédio desta força ígnea, já que esta séfira é o “Yod” do segundo ciclo e em razão desta união com Kether que também é “Yod” mas no primeiro ciclo. E como Geburah é o “He” de seu ciclo, funde-se ainda com Hesed como o “Yod” do segundo ciclo – ciclo este em que é o “He” de Hochmah e o segundo “He” do triângulo logoico.
Assim, o rigor de Geburah se unirá a bondade de Hesed fazendo com que o bem e o mal trabalhem juntos impulsionados pela vontade de obrar que, como resultado, tenderá a abrir caminhos. Temos, então, o fogo e a agua trabalhando juntos, contudo, ainda não há grande harmonia.
Quando o cinco de paus atua em Atziluth esta vontade primordial de um objetivo a ser alcançado, mesmo com a união de duas forças antagônicas, vem desde o ponto mais alto, onde tudo se instituirá e descerá com força primogênita aos planos inferiores.
1.5       Virtudes concedidas:
1º.- Facilidade em viver em paz com todo mundo
2º.- O conhecimento das altas ciências, filosofia oculta e da teosofia
3º.- Facilidade de aprendizagem (indicado em períodos de exames)
4º.- Melhorar o caráter e alcançar maior beleza física
5º.- Combater as más qualidades do corpo e da alma
1.6        Descrição Sephiroth:
MAHASIAH é o quinto da 1ª ordem de anjos denominado como Coro dos Serafins, situa-se na morada filosofal de número 5, subsendeiro que une Kether a Geburah em sua trajetória de ida ou descenso pela árvore e zodíaco. Trata das forças Kether o primeiro ponto de partida na Arvore e no zodíaco, o centro produtor de iniciativas, a essência divina e, neste ponto, manifesta seus fluxos mediante as pulsações de Geburah, a séfira emocional que trata dos reajustes, da atuação dinâmica da Justiça na correção dos erros e cujos verbos são: restaurar, reparar, retificar; “Yod” do Mundo de Atziluth sobre o “He” do Mundo de Briah, Fogo do Fogo atuando sobre o Água da Água. Nesta casa nos deparamos com a essência filosofal chamada VITRIOL, o conjunto de qualidades, propriedades e atributos responsáveis pela retificação da obra, quanto mais refira-se as emoções. Trata-se de uma força de Vontade Retificadora, concessora da capacidade de retificar o que está saindo torcido antes mesmo que se produza, a evidência do erro ou que este se materialize, de modo que possamos viver em paz conosco e com todo mundo, eis que passamos a atuar em consonância com os desígnios divinos, emerge em nosso interior a Vontade de aprender o transcendente que passa a ser percebido pelas imagens, reflexo dos movimentos primordiais nos planos mais altos. Daí vem o atributo, esta qualidade imbuída de poder denominada Deus salvador.
MAHASIAH pertence ao coro de Serafins que habita nos mundos de Atziluth, mundo das emanações, e recebe influência das energias de Geburah que pertence a coluna da severidade, sendo aí o segundo, pois está logo abaixo de Binah, portanto é o executor do legislador supremo, eis que, reside no mundo de Briah, o mundo das emoções, o “He” deste plano e o “He” da coluna da severidade. Então temos um Serafim que trabalha alquimicamente no triangulo logoico (Kether, Hochmah e Binah) e no triangulo ético (Hesed, Geburah e Tiphereth) simultaneamente.
Este quinto anjo do coro dos Serafins é o responsável pelo desenvolvimento das energias de Geburah em nosso interior e sua essência é chamada de VITRIOL, muito conhecida pelos alquimistas que a utilizavam para retificar a obra.
Sendo MAHASIAH o portador do “He” em duas dimensões da agua – “He” da coluna da severidade e “He” do triangulo ético faz suas retificações pelas emoções. Lembremos que o batismo é efetuado pela Agua, que é tida como o espírito de Deus que tira o pecado do mundo. A agua lava o sangue (onde estão depositados o nosso karma) em nossos rins que representam esotericamente a balança da Lei, da justiça.
O sangue é retificado pela Água que representa as nossas emoções. Como é no corpo, o é no espírito conforme é referendado pela máxima de Hermes: “Assim como é em cima e em baixo e como é embaixo o é em cima”.
Na oração do pai nosso temos que: Seja feita a tua vontade assim na terra como nos seus. Deus fez o homem a sua imagem e semelhança, portanto, o homem é o universo em miniatura. Conhecendo as pequenas coisas, se conhece as grandes. Eis aqui um dos maiores segredos da filosofia oculta que dá acesso a conhecimentos sem fim.
VITRIOL ou V.I.T.R.I.O.L. é a sigla da expressão, do latim “Visita Interiorem Terrae, Rectificando, Invenies Occultum Lapidem”, o que quer dizer: Visita o Centro da Terra, Retificando-te, encontrarás a Pedra Oculta (ou Filosofal).
A pedra filosofal é também conhecida como a pedra cúbica de Yesod que é a séfira que fica logo acima de Malkuth, o número nove da arvore – nove é o número do homem, que demora cerca de 9 meses preparando um veículo de manifestação para atuar neste mundo em que vivemos atualmente.
As duas colunas que sustentam todo o edifício do templo, são o homem e a mulher. A nona esfera na árvore Sephiroth, que é réplica do corpo humano, e onde sem encontra a região sexual.
A pedra cúbica de Yesod possui 9 lados e difere da pedra cúbica de Tiphereth que possui 6 e que ao ser desdobrada forma a cruz do calvário que também é um signo sexual, simbologia da do falo (vertical) penetrando o útero (horizontal); a cruz egípcia dava uma representação a mais do útero.
No ponto central das cidades é comum vermos como marco a pedra cúbica de nove lados. Sua forma lembra um falo, comumente chamada de obelisco. Um dos mais famosos obeliscos é o de Luxor com 23 metros de altura que foi colocado no centro da Praça da Concórdia após ter sido retirado do Templo de Luxor.
O acróstico VITRIOL com suas sete letras e suas sete palavras simbolizam a grande obra, os mistérios do arcano 7.
As sete pontas da grande estrela da alquimia possuem sete assinaturas sagradas relacionadas as energias dos sete planetas.
As sete palavras que formam VITRIOL e o círculo duplo das formas masculinas e femininas rodeiam a Grande Estrela septenária que resplandece como um sol no templo da ciência hermética.
Marcam os dias da semana na ordem de dos planetas começando pelo sábado representado por Saturno (o único que não foi mudado pela igreja romana) e segue domingo-Lua, segunda-mercúrio, terça-Vênus, quarta-Sol, quinta-Marte, sexta-Júpiter segundo a ordem de Ptolomeu.
O Sol e a Lua, o Fogo e a Agua, o Rei e a Rainha, formam parte integrante do trabalho dos alquimistas. São sete trabalhos que culminam na coroação da Grande Obra. No centro da Estrela Setenária da alquimia, aparece gravado o rosto de um venerável ancião, de acordo com a ilustração do Viridarium Chymicum. Este rosto venerável da Estrela Setenária simboliza o mercúrio sulfurado, o Ens Seminis.
“Escutem pombinhos da alquimia, escutem Estolsio explicando este emblema: “Aquilo que, antes estava encerrado em muitas formas, o vês agora incluído em uma só. O começo é nosso velho e ele tem a chave. O enxofre (Fogo), com o mercúrio (azougue – Agua) e com o sal (Terra filosófica) dão riqueza. Se nada vês aqui, não há razão para que sigas buscando, pois, serás cego ainda que no meio da Luz.””
No Arcano A.Z.F., encontramos as doze chaves secretas do beneditino de Erfurt, Basílio Valentim (manuscrito do Azoth de Valentim). Encontramos ainda os segredos por traz do misterioso nome de João – IAO (I (ignis) – fogo; A (aqua) – água; O (origo) – princípio).
“Hermes diz:
O que é anterior tem que corresponder ao que é abaixo, se alguém deseja realizar tais trabalhos de maravilha, com arte e poder.
Os planetas comoventes podem ser vistos parado nos céus.
A terra com seus metais preciosos se assemelha a eles exatamente.
O pai desta pedra é o sol; A mãe é a lua;
O vento gestou a recompensa em seu útero;
A terra nutriu isto ternamente”
Vejamos o exorcismo da agua:
“Fiat firmaméntum in médio aquárium et sepáret áquas ab aquis, quae supérius sicut inférius, et quae inférius sicut quae supérius, ad perpetránda mirácula rei uníus. Sol ejus pater est, luna máter et ventus hanc gestávit in útero suo, ascéndit a térra ad coelum et rúrsus a coelo in térram descéndit. Exórciso te, creatúra áquae, ut sis mihi spéculum Dei vivi in opéribus ejus, et fons vitae, et ablútio peccatórum. Amen”.
Quando tratamos da pedra já não estamos falando da Arvore do conhecimento do bem e do mal, mas sim da Arvore da Vida, pois a vida é criada pela união sexual. Em qualquer coisa que seja que envolva a criação o positivo e o negativo estarão sempre presentes.
MAHASIAH nos auxilia a retificar nossa terra interior a enfrentar o mar de emoções que nos sacode, nos atormenta, e para isto utiliza das energias da Pedra Filosofal oriundas da energia não desperdiçada. Sempre que vermos o termo pedra, Pedro, Patar etc. em termos de ciência oculta estaremos falando de sexo.
Outros gênios que tratam da pedra filosofal:
1->4 ELEMIAH: nos fornece a Vontade Poderosa para realização da alquimia.
1->5 MAHASIAH: Retificação da obra VITRIOL.
7->4 HAHASIAH: Pedra filosofal, verdade primeira para cura.
Outros Gênios trabalham com a retificação, assim em resumo temos:
1->5 MAHASIAH: Retifica o erro antes mesmo que se produza as evidências ou se materialize;
2->5 HAHAIAH: Cria as circunstâncias que permitem retificar os erros;
3->5 PAHALIAH Redenção – permite retificar os erros – Inteligência Retificadora (interna).
1.7       Das virtudes concedidas:
1.7.1    Facilidade em viver em paz com todo mundo
O Gênio anterior, ELEMIAH, pertencente a esfera de Hesed, sendo um grande emanador de energia regozijante pode acarretar que haja desperdício por parte de quem a receba, ao passo que estas energias mal utilizadas ou desperdiçadas terminam por descer para as infra regiões e acabam sendo seccionadas pelos nossos lúciferes internos que tem a função de transformar as trevas em luz por meio da obscuridade. Nestes momentos, surge MAHASIAH para nos salvar do naufrágio e salvar-nos das tribulações, produto de nossas próprias energias degradadas.
Outros Gênios trabalham com a salvação de situações difíceis:
1->5 MAHASIAH: Vontade salvadora;
2->5 HAHAIAH: Circunstância salvadora;
3->5 PAHALIAH: Inteligência salvadora.
Como estamos tratando de retificação, este Gênio faz justamente isto, retificar o que está torcido, fora do lugar antes mesmo que haja algum dano, fato é que opera no mundo de Atziluth, conhecido também como mudo das emanações e, assim, atua em um momento anterior a qualquer manifestação já que procede quando o erro ainda está em nosso mar interno, em nossas emoções acertando tudo até o desembarque no porto de Malkuth, a materialização dos pensamentos, sentimentos, que ainda estão nos planos acima.
Trata-se da retificação de nossas aguas internas, de nossos complexos emotivos, das planificações baseadas nos sentimentos. Podemos chamar esta força ainda como Vontade Reconsideradora já que trata também de um exame de consciência que desagua na reparação dos danos. Então temos uma mudança de consciência interior que encontrará no exterior sua contraparte de perfeição, reflexo do que ocorreu por dentro.
O plano dos 72 gênios consiste em uma atuação de maneira perfeita e integrada nos proporcionando informações a cada passo que damos, cada Gênio em sua especialidade, a fim de que os erros possam ser retificados no mesmo momento em que são cometidos no intento de que a realização material ocorra sem atropelos.
Se possuímos VITRIOL em nossas alforjas, em nossa bagagem espiritual, se armazenamos esta energia dentro de no interior, estaremos retificando os nossos erros no mesmo momento em que ocorrem evitando-se assim a criação de mais karmas para nossas existências.
Será possível viver em paz com todo mundo, o que ocorre quando o desígnio divino e os nossos desejos perseguem um objetivo comum. Do que desaparecem as agitações, os desassossegos, pois não há conflito entre a manifestação física e a divina.
Diferentemente do que se pense o estado de paz não é passivo, muito pelo contrário é um estado de ânimo que contagia e irrompe as naturezas atormentadas para trazer-lhes o sossego e a lucidez.
Ao verificar que alguma coisa saiu fora do contexto invoque MAHASIAH pois este criará as condições necessárias para reparação do dano sem maiores consequências. Aguarde seu sinal, a oportunidade será mostrada em um momento qualquer por isto temos que estar despertos, faça a sua parte e retifique seus sentimentos, pensamentos e ações.
Conserve em sua vida um frasco de VITRIOL para entrar para a categoria daqueles que vivem em paz e a espalhe aqueles que de você se aproximam.
Como MAHASIAH traz a paz aos que rodeiam, aquele que possui esta essência em sua alforja espiritual, domina, as reconciliações e disporá de um grande poder de realizar as Vontades, o que vem de nosso Ser Interno, pelas vias da harmonia energética (cabe esclarecer que os desejos provêm do ego e a Vontade de nosso Real Ser).
Outros Gênios que nos auxiliam a viver em paz:
1->2 JELIEL: Restabelece a paz entre esposos pela união da Vontade e Amor-sabedoria;
1->5 MAHASIAH: Pela retificação dos erros e sincronicidade com os desígnios divinos;
1->6 LELAHEL: Paz fruto da Vontade harmoniosa, pacífica e consciente;
4->2 NITH-HAIAH: Paz da solidão para alcançar a verdade e a sabedoria;
4->4 YERATHEL: Paz em ambiente justo e homens sábios;
5->3 LEHAHIAH: Paz entre os governantes – sem guerras. Guerra contra os desejos;
5->4 CHAVAKIAH: Paz e harmonia nas famílias e com todos, reconciliação com o passado;
5->7 HAAMIAH: Viver em Paz com a sociedade, proteção espiritual;
5->9 IEIAZEL: Para que os inimigos nos deixem em paz em razão de uma Nova Realidade;
6->4 VEULIAH: Paz mediante a guerra para retirada do usurpador e, pelo perfeito ordenamento natural das coisas na dinâmica יהוה;
6->5 YLAHIAH: Disposição para a paz com inimigos que fomos injustos;
6->9 MIHAEL: Paz e harmonia entre esposos;
8->7 IAH-HEL: Tranquilidade e solidão para alcançar a sabedoria;
9->8 HAIAIEL: Destruição da babilónia interna e externa, paz para quem está em guerra.
1.7.2    O conhecimento das altas ciências, filosofia oculta, teosofia e as artes liberais
Como este Gênio atua no mundo dos desejos, das criações, em Briah, a palavra mágica aqui é desejar que deve ser convertida no querer (da Vontade). Na esfera dos desejos a ciência que se aprende e “querer algo”, de possuí-lo. Sua realização é imediata, diferentemente do que ocorre no mundo material onde para se possuir algo deve-se esperar que alguém o desocupe. Isto ocorre porque o querer, a Vontade não é uma posse material, mas inicialmente espiritual, tudo se realiza por meio da imagem.
É interessante notar aqui que MAHASIAH encontra-se na posição referente ao terceiro decanato de Áries, ao passo que um dos atributos do Gênio Satander, que rege este decanato, é encontrar um lugar em um espaço já ocupado, ou seja, onde atua o corporativismo, a reserva de mercado, a xenofobia, enfim, e cuja antítese, sua contraparte infernal, é produtora de grande dano e é claro karma.
Mas prosseguindo, o que se pretende aqui é o desejo de aprender o transcendente -já que estamos trabalhando no mundo das emanações -, o que ocorre nos dias é horas de MAHASIAH se estamos com a consciência desperta. Então o conhecimento vem em forma de imagens como as que dão lugar a um cerimonial, do mesmo modo que utilizam as igrejas e ordens iniciáticas. E para compreendermos faz-se necessário decifrar as formas e converter as imagens em conhecimentos, a ciência que se oculta nos objetos da cerimônia e no ritual.
Por estar ligado a Kether este Gênio dispõe do elemento primordial, iniciador, o que permite a criação destes rituais ao passo que o Gênio 38 HAAMIAH esteja mais ligado a execução, utilização, conservação, também a compreensão.
MAHASIAH participa da formação de nosso Geburah interno em que uma das virtudes é ser o mestre do ritual, o denominado expert das sociedades iniciáticas, aquele que domina o ritual até a perfeição aquele que acompanha o neófito na iniciação.
MAHASIAH nos conduzira com segurança quando nossos olhos ainda estejam vendados, com vistas as realidades transcendentes; segura em nossa mão enquanto superamos os baques do caminho.
E como estamos tratando da criação de rituais cabe esclarecer que não se trata somente do que ocorre nas sociedades iniciáticas, mas, refere-se à criação de todos os procedimentos que consagram algum ritmo, sejam manufaturas, procedimentos burocráticos etc., já que a Vontade de Kether se impõe sobre o agente executor de Binah.
No mundo de hoje muitas pessoas usurpam as premissas do alto e mesmo as da terra, ocupam lugares em que não deveriam estar. São alocadas pelo clientelismo, pelo nepotismo, por pertencerem a esta ou aquela escola de mistérios onde a ajuda a irmandade é incondicional e, assim, se ligam as energias abismais. Como não estão conectadas as forças superiores, seus atos, do mesmo modo, procedem das regiões baixas e terminam por institucionalizar o inferno na terra.
Burocratizar para criar dificuldades, mitigar o direito alheio, dificultar a vida do outro, gera karma, ainda que feito com boas intenções. Ao realiza-lo a própria existência dos responsáveis ficam amarradas. Não conseguem levar nada adiante, por onde caminha encontrará obstáculos, impecílios. Por vezes não há o retorno imediato do mal efetuado já que uma outra energia (dhármica) pode ainda estar sendo queimada
O karma em geral recai sobre a própria pessoa, sobre os responsáveis que estão acima dela que detém o poder de mando e resultado – mesmo que não fiscalizem; mas também se reflete sobre a família, pois a união familiar é o resultado da conglomeração de afinidades vibratórias, e se estende até a quinta geração conforme preceitua os textos tradicionais, eis que se refere a cada uma das letras do nome impronunciável acrescida da quintessência.
O chefe, diretor, político, juiz, etc. que, covardemente, utilizam seus subordinados para produzirem o mal indireto, imiscuindo-se de aparecerem, não escapam de suas responsabilidades. Tudo está armazenado no subconsciente de cada um. Se a Justiça da terra e cega, ou se faz de cega, a do alto não o é, pelo simples fato de que não é possível fugir de si mesmo. Um departamento, qualquer que seja, é o espelho de sua chefia. Tudo o que ocorre ali é fruto da ação ou da omissão de quem a dirige. Grandes cargos, de grandes responsabilidades, concedem grandes benesses, seja monetária, desfrutes, ou o que for, mas nas mãos da pessoa errada dará frutos amargos e gerará inexoravelmente pesados karmas. Assumir um cargo ou função de alto nível deveria ser um ato de muita meditação e não de ganância já que como é sabido: O poder corrompe. No final de tudo, quase sempre, há um preço a quitar.
A burocracia não é um mal exclusivo dos órgãos públicos, relativos ao papel, mas também o encontramos nos ambulatórios estatais ou não. Médicos que não conseguem organizar uma agenda e deixam uma grande quantidade de pessoas a sua espera, no comércio, nos bancos onde se demora muito tempo para ser atendido, pagar uma conta etc. Roubar, administrar mal o tempo do próximo também é um delito, quanto mais este tempo seja precioso para indivíduo ou para um grupo de pessoas, uma atividade qualquer.
MAHASIAH auxilia a gerar os procedimentos burocráticos que não venham a prejudicar, emperrar a vida das pessoas, empresas etc. Pois carrega em si o poderoso raio de Kether – que vislumbra desde o ponto mais alto -, a Vontade que arrebenta tudo que está em seu caminho pelas vias do exército de Geburah, outra força esta de caráter disciplinada, obediente e explosiva.
Outros Gênios trabalham com o ritual:
1->5 MAHASIAH: Mestre do ritual, cria o rito e acompanha o iniciado;
38 5->7 HAAMIAH: Responsável por todos os rituais, cerimoniais, conjuros, execução, compreensão.
MAHASIAH nos ensina a interpretação as anedotas cotidianas. Dessa forma graças aos seus ensinamentos quando a vida nos dispõe de um sinal o saberemos interpretar. Compreenderemos o que nos está sendo indicado em razão de um objeto, número, pessoa que se depara ante nós casuisticamente e nos interpela ou pede algo, uma situação qualquer. E de repente o mundo parecerá estranho, nos damos conta que não foi o acaso e nos dispomos a interpretar a mensagem.
Pode acontecer que solicitemos a ajuda de um Gênio e após a concessão este venha nos cobrar o preço; eis que talvez não tenhamos mérito ou mesmo para informar que o pedido foi aceiro ou concedido. Então aparece alguém pedindo ajuda e o fazemos. Feito isto a pessoa que ajudamos nos abençoa justamente naquilo em que estávamos necessitando.
Compreenderemos assim o porquê dos vários acontecimentos da vida.
1.7.3    Facilidade de aprendizagem (indicado em períodos de exames)
O programa do Gênio insta que a pessoa nascida sob essa influência aprenderá tudo o que quiser facilmente.
Consideremos que Geburah é o “He” da coluna da severidade, o “He” do mundo de Briah cujo “Yod” é Hesed e que MAHASIAH é a força de Kether sob as influências de Geburah. Sendo este Gênio da coluna da severidade o filho de Binah, recebe deste as mais diversas influências, inclusive o conhecimento dos Registros Akáshicos da Natureza que ficam acumulados neste departamento e de onde provém e estão armazenadas todas as memórias da criação como se fosse um HD (hard disk) sem limites de armazenamento.
Como MAHASIAH está em um nível muito alto, acessa conhecimentos da própria criação, muito superiores e, como sua força principal que vem de Kether. Isto lhe garante inteligência e resistência para o aprendizado por um longo tempo. As influências de Hesed propõe um sedativo ao cansaço e também acesso a sabedoria de Hochmah do qual é o primeiro “He”. Daí vem a recomendação para o estudo para provas difíceis e exames.
1.7.4    Melhorar o caráter e alcançar maior beleza física
Todos desejam ter um aparência e simpatia agradável aos olhos de todos. Estes predicados abrem muitas portas. Quem pode, passa pelo bisturi para tanto. Este Gênio estabelece uma relação entre o conhecimento que interiorizamos e o físico que temos.
Nossa imagem é um cartão de visitas e, por muitas vezes, nos precedem. Contudo quando o interior não está bem, não há plástica que possa resolver, pois a aura negativa transcende a matéria e transmite ao subconsciente dos que nos rodeiam a imagem interna. Pode-se fazê-lo inclusive materialmente pela manifestação descortês, maus modos, humilhando o outro, o adversário, o cliente – tratando-o como se estivesse fazendo o favor de vender-lhe seus produtos. Tais manifestações insolentes geram desarmonia, circunstâncias perigosas, contratempos, obstáculos de todo gênero.
Pode causar estranheza que marte seja responsável por uma aparência agradável já que as pessoas com muito desta energia não tem a melhor das aparências.
O que ocorre aqui é que estamos tratando do Marte primordial, ligado a Kether, quando ainda não sofreu as influências abismais que põe o furor em sua face. O Marte primordial é um portador de paz, que corrige os abusos das deliciosas energias de Júpiter em sua exaltação, o que lança a semente dos múltiplos desejos.
Nesse sentido, figura a paixão pelos prazeres honestos, resultado das energias do Júpiter exaltado com os freios de Marte. A satisfação pelo conhecimento que nos proporciona supera em intensidade a qualquer outro prazer. Trata-se do gozo que se produz em nós a penetração das forças superiores, ao passo que, o prazer que nos vem de baixo, é somente um fragmento.
1.7.5       Combater as más qualidades do corpo e da alma
O lado negativo da força
A contraparte de MAHASIAH refere-se a ignorância, a libertinagem e as más qualidades do corpo e da alma.
O prazer sexual produzido aqui está diretamente ligado as influências marcianas abismais, sendo o oposto do prazer proporcionado pela realização das grandes obras quando levadas a efeito. Trata-se dos prazeres puramente carnais em contrapartida com os relativos ao sexo espiritualizado em que as energias não são desperdiçadas, mas sobem pela colona vertebral em direção ao cérebro e posteriormente direcionadas ao coração que a distribui a todo o universo dos corpos físicos e espirituais.
Desta forma percebemos que a ignorância citada se refere ao desconhecimento das altas ciências e o recusar-se em aprendê-las, afastando-nos da fonte de sabedoria. Então se ouve: não me conte, não quero ouvir, não posso concordar porque terei que sair de minha zona de conforto…
Esta ignorância pode manifestar-se sobre a forma de Caifas (o demônio da mente e também o precursor das falsas doutrinas – já estudado) fazendo com que o indivíduo entre em uma linha de pensamento, seita, escola, rituais, religião que professe o oposto do que deveria ser, daquilo que deliberadamente quer ignorar. Aqui não há intenção de retificar o erro.
A libertinagem refere-se a busca do prazer sem o conhecimento da obra. Desta forma a ignorância e a libertinagem produzirão como karma as más qualidades do corpo e da alma e, em uma próxima existência, uma vez sofrida as consequências, sobrevirá o afã desmensurado por obras e pelo saber.
Enquanto as energias de MAHASIAH dos planos superiores coordenam a paz, a harmonia, sua contraparte abismal declarará a guerra para compreender o valor da paz.
1.8       Escrituras
S 34:6 (33-5) Quaesivi Dominum et exaudivit me et de omnibus angustiis meis liberavit me.
Busquei ao Eterno e ele me respondeu: livrou-me de todas as minhas tribulações.”
1.9        Oração
MAHASIAH: Deus salvador.
MAHASIAH: Não permitas que as virtudes que Tu acumulastes em minha alma
se convertam em um obstáculo para minha evolução.
Fazei com que eu compreenda, MAHASIAH,
que para exercer o magistério de Tua Alta Ciência
é preciso que liquide as contas
com aqueles que foram companheiros de jornada no passado.
Ajuda-me, Senhor, para que minha razão não fique enuviada no momento da prova,
para que não me identifique com a tribulação.
E quando a dinâmica do tempo haja limpado todos os rincões de minha alma,
aceita-me, Senhor, como seu ministro na terra.
Dá-me um luar onde possa oficiar,
onde possa render testemunho da ordem que Tú representas.
1.10    Exortação
Tudo está por fazer.
O mundo era um jardim quando Eu esfriei a crosta terrestre
para que vós possais viver sobre ela.
Haveis lá convertido em uma podridão a vossa imagem e semelhança,
porque em Vós apodrecem também as velhas maldades que cultivas,
inclusive com orgulho, sem intenção de transmutá-las,
porque nela radica unicamente vossa dignidade.
Porém, quando decidais lavar vossa alma,
quando decidais pedir o saldo de vossa conta,
tragando todas as cobranças de vosso karma,
já não sereis mais elementos poluidores e a natureza em que vives,
a vossa imagem e semelhança, recuperará sua primogênita saúde.
Inócuos, perversos, degradados de toda estirpe,
em Mim encontrareis novos títulos de nobreza.
Eu restituirei vossa dignidade perdida e,
de Mim recebereis o mandato para restituir a terra a sua inocência primitiva.
Desde agora mesmo, vossa tarefa será a de recriar um novo Éden.
Oração e exortação de Kabaleb.

“Posso nao concordar com o que você faz, mas lutarei até a morte pelo seu direito de continuar fazendo.”  Voltaire
Como entrar com ações contra o exame de ordem da OAB? Não há como sustentar a exclusão de +++ 4 MILHÕES +++ de bacharéis de direito que estão fora do mercado de trabalho em virtude do corporativismo, de uma confraria e da reserva de mercado. Este número é absurdo e só tende a aumentar. Para tudo explodir é uma questão de tempo… Milhares de bacharéis estão entrando com as ações.
Na barra a direita e acima possuimos uma Categoria completa, com materiais relativo aos exames de ordem - Decisões - Modelos de petições - Projetos de Lei - e muita matéria do que vem ocorrendo DIVULGUE este material...
Quem sai prejudicado? R. A população mais carente que não pode ter acesso a justiça em virtude do auto custo de um advogado...
Quem defende este exame? R. -> A OAB, advogados que terão que dividir o pão com mais de 4 MILHÕES de Bacharéis que se tornarão Advogados...
Eles lutarão até o último suspiro para que isto não ocorra, mas nos continuaremos lutando quando não houver mais suspiro...

1.2        Palavras chaves:
LUZ, paz CURA (cromoterapia e consciência), iluminação, FORTUNA, amor, RENOME, ciência, artes, PROSPERIDADE, – Afã de viver em PAZ.
(-) AMBIÇÃO, cobiça, meios ilícitos, trapaça, DINHEIRO SUJO, vontade de ignorância, vontade sinistra de gozo.
1.3        Movimentação Sephiroth: As na sexta posição.
Neste ponto quando o 1 atua no 6 nos deparamos com Kether influindo no centro da coluna vertebral onde encontra-se Tiphereth. Astrologicamente refere-se a Netuno em Leão (Leão da tribo de Judá), quando Deus e o homem se deram as mãos em Cristo, a substância que deve tornar-se carne em nós.
Dessarte, passa a atuar em Tiphereth, ou seja, a Vontade se libera da servidão dos desejos, das emoções, próprios do Mundo de Briah e caminha rumo as realizações intelectuais. A Coroa manifesta seus fluxos mediante ao amor, por faze-lo em seu “He” natural, i.e., Tiphereth, assim, trabalham juntas a intuição e as emoções superiores. Proporciona que a Vontade se manifeste em um universo equilibrado, resultante da expressão dos centros acima já que Tiphereth atua como um centro de equilíbrio, sabedoria, prudência de todas estas forças emanadas até então.
Como resultado material nos depararemos com o juiz, o sábio, conselheiro todos quantos manifestem esta luz equilibrada que dará origem a um novo universo.
1.4        Arcano – Mundo: Seis de paus mundo de Atziluth.
Recebe o título de Senhor da Vitória. Refere-se ao elemento Fogo e astrologicamente corresponde a posição do Sol transitando pelo terceiro decanato de Leão onde manifesta seus fluxos mediante as roupagens deste signo e sob as pulsações do regente deste decanato que é o Sol.
Neste ponto, Kether o primeiro ponto de partida na Arvore e no zodíaco, o centro produtor de iniciativas, a essência divina, expressa-se por intermédio de Tiphereth, a séfira que transmite mais LUZ que qualquer outra, responsável pela consciência, que tudo harmoniza, e pela manifestação da Vontade de Kether a nível prático. No mais, o resultado desta alquimia se exteriorizara ainda pelo tom prismático de Hesed, o coordenador deste subciclo evolutivo.
Aqui a força “Vô” impulsa o desenvolvimento exuberante da planta – neste momento em que sai da terra e se desenvolve. Então temos a frutificação de Hesed no paraíso de Tiphereth.
Sabemos que em Hesed tudo se desenvolve indistintamente, sem restrições e que, em um futuro, termina por acarretar a intervenção de Geburah. Contudo, como Tiphereth exerce a função de “Vô”, como Binah, este mesmo mecanismo de restrição elimina a necessidade da atuação de Geburah, o que significa um grande prenúncio de vitória equilibrada e justa. Dessarte, esta força equilibrante atua de forma definitiva sobre a Lei primordial trazendo a paz e a unidade perdida.
Quando o seis de paus se manifesta no mundo de Atziluth temos que a força da Vontade se manifesta de modo equilibrante desde o ponto das emanações onde a força inicial não encontra oposições porque não há nada que a anteceda ou haja podido se organizar anteriormente para criar obstáculos.
1.5       Virtudes concedidas:
1º.- Cura das enfermidades
2º.- Iluminação espiritual
3º.- Renome e fortuna nas ciências e nas artes
4º.- O amor de uma pessoa afortunada
5º.- Proteção contra a ambição desmensurada e a cobiça.
1.6        Descrição Sephiroth:
LELAHEL é o sexto da 1º ordem de anjos denominado como Coro dos Serafins, situa-se na morada filosofal de número 6, rege o sendeiro 13, que une Kether a Tiphereth em sua trajetória de ida ou descenso pelas árvore e zodíaco. Trata das forças de Kether o primeiro ponto de partida na Arvore e no zodíaco, o centro produtor de iniciativas, a essência divina e, neste ponto, manifesta seus fluxos mediante as pulsações de Tiphereth, a séfira que transmite mais LUZ que qualquer outra, responsável pela consciência, que tudo harmoniza, e pela manifestação da Vontade de Kether a nível prático; “Yod” do Mundo de Atziluth sobre o “Vô” do Mundo de Briah, Fogo do Fogo atuando sobre o Ar da Agua. Assim, nesta casa nos deparamos com a essência filosofal chamada LUZ, o conjunto de qualidades, propriedades e atributos que nos auxilia e entender, compreender as coisas, desenvolver, despertar a nossa consciência pela sua utilização, colocando-a em atividade. Trata-se de uma força de Vontade harmonizadora, que nos permite a valorizar o que é certo e o que não está correto em suas atuações, uma vez que providencia que tudo anteceda ao crivo da consciência representado pelo Sol, e conduz o viver em PAZ, o brilhar, o refletir das energias que emanam do alto cujo resultado manifesto configura-se em o seu enaltecimento. Daí vem o atributo, esta qualidade imbuída de poder denominada Deus louvável.
Aqui temos a ação de Kether, a coroa do triângulo logoico, atuando sobre Tiphereth o “Vô” do triângulo ético. O triângulo ético é um espelhamento do triangulo logoico então vemos a harmonia da vontade suprema, o seu reflexo em um pano mais abaixo denotando a unidade e harmonia de desígnios.
De outro lado Tiphereth se comunica com todas as séfiras e, sendo o reflexo da vontade do Pai: a transmite para todos.
“Mateus 23:9. E a ninguém na terra chameis vosso pai, porque há um que é o vosso pai, e Ele está nos céus.”
De igual modo recebe desígnios em particular. No que tange ao triângulo logoico, inicialmente, percebe diretamente a vontade do Kether o que nos remete a passagem que afirma: Quem viu ao Pai, viu a Mim”; posteriormente possui ligações diretas com Hochmah pelas vias do sendeiro número quinze pelo fato de Hochmah ser o “He” de Atziluth e Tiphereth estar em Briah, o “He” dos mundos, ou ainda por ser o “He” da coluna do equilíbrio. E do mesmo modo possui ligações com Hesed como “He” do pilar da misericórdia e com Geburah por ser o “He” do pilar da severidade.
De outro ponto vemos que Tiphereth estando na posição “Vô” de Briah é um emanador das energias de Binah.
Percebemos que Tiphereth é uma séfira de excepcional harmonia e em LELAHEL esta harmonia se destaca em atender a vontade de Kether.
Esta sexta morada, em meio a tanta harmonia, recebe o nome de LUZ. Vale lembrar, que no antigo Egito, na cidade de Luxor (luz), havia em templo dedicado ao Sol (Amon-Ra) símbolo material de Tiphereth, o Cristo.
Analisando as estátuas percebemos que em seus rituais cruzavam o braço direito sobre o esquerdo formando a estrela de cinco pontas em seu aspecto positivo.
As forças abismais são invocadas fazendo-se a posição ao contrário, ou seja, colocando-se o braço esquerdo sobre o direito ou juntando-se a palma da mão ao ombro – desta forma a estrela fica invertida.
No Gênesis percebemos que a LUZ provém de Kether. Então a essência chamada LUZ nos permite entender, compreender as coisas desde um ponto de vista superior já que estamos tratando do mundo das emanações e criação.
Se analisarmos o Gênesis, perceberemos que o sol foi criado no quarto dia (Gênesis 1:16), ao passo que a LUZ no primeiro (Gênesis 1:3). Tal explicação só se consubstancia a luz das iniciações espirituais, eis que o quarto chacra ligado ao corpo causal, o Manas inferior está associado Tiphereth.
Possuímos em nossos corpos sete centros básicos de energia que na cultura ocidental estão simbolizadas pelas sete igrejas constantes no apocalipse a saber:
Muladhara (Igreja de Éfeso ou Básico)
Situado na região compreendida entre os genitais e o ânus, e sua raiz fica na ponta da espinha dorsal. Conecta-nos ao elemento Terra e com o tattwa Pritivi.
Swadhishtana (Igreja de Smirna, Prostático; chamado de uterino, nas mulheres)
Situa-se a quatro dedos acima dos órgãos sexuais, no púbis. Com ele trabalhamos o Tattwa Apas, com os elementais das águas;
Manipura (Igreja de Pérgamo ou Solar):
Está situada no plexo solar e com ela trabalhamos o tattwa Tejas que corresponde ao elemento ígneo;
Anahát (Igreja de Tiatira, Cárdias):
Trata-se do chacra cardíaco, por nos ligar aos elementais do Ar, por conseguinte com o tattwa Vaio;
Cabe lembrar aqui da existência dos 10 sons Anahat, a “Voz de Brahama”, esse som que entoa como o canto do grilo, o silvo da serpente e que possibilitam as saídas astrais conscientes. Basta adormecer vocalizando a letra S, como um silvo suave e aprazível: SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS, e assim, com a vocalização desta letra, fará ressoar em seu cérebro a “Sutil Voz”, o “Som Anahat”, a Vontade, que o permitirá sair conscientemente em corpo astral.
Vishudda (Igreja de Sárdis)
Ajna (igreja de Filadélfia) sede do terceiro olho e
Sahásrara (igreja de Laodicéia)
Estes três últimos situam-se na região Laríngea, Frontal e Coronário (coroa, cabeça). Seu despertar nos põe em contato com a Loja Branca Atômica de nosso Ser cuja representação física situa-se no cérebro. Esses três chacras sagrados têm sob sua influência outros, como o do cerebelo, o “chacra oculto” de Daat.
O ponto que nos interessa no momento é o Sol, criado no quarto dia, refere-se a Tiphereth, cujo centro energético encontra-se no plexo solar no chacra Manipura (Igreja de Pérgamo ou Solar).
Este centro está ligado ao mundo causal, ou seja, o mundo das causas naturais, situado na 6º dimensão, o que significa que todo o fluxo de consciência que se projeta para baixo tem o seu lançamento, sua origem, deste ponto onde a LUZ criada no primeiro dia tem sua primeira exteriorização, como criação de Tiphereth, que projeta o mundo arquitetado por Binah em uma manifestação solar, i. e., pelo SOL.
A Cosmogonia de Fabre D’Olivet trata de passagem da consciência da obscuridade (força compressiva, rígida) para a Luz (elementização, reunião de elementos inteligíveis, liberdade). Cabe ressaltar que a palavra LUZ em hebraico é uma derivação da palavra fogo. Elemento relacionado ao chacra em questão.
Então podemos concluir que LUX está relacionado a consciência, alma, fogo, energia que por sua vez tem seu jorro inteligível a partir de Tiphereth.
É sabido que os magos negros, os que utilizam as forças da criação de forma negativa, destrutiva, violando as regras do próprio funcionamento do universo, tem acesso apenas até o mundo astral e mental inferior, daí que não conseguirem atingir quem ou aquele que se eleva espiritualmente e, como as forças emanadas devem ter seu curso, acaba voltando a via originária causando o dano em quem a produziu.
Os videntes comuns raramente chegam a ver além dos mundos astral e mental, por isto suas visões referem-se a realidades mais imediatas, enquanto as do mundo causal a visão é muito mais distante. É onde espreitam os grandes profetas cujas predições são objeto de risos e são rechaçadas pelos de pouca visão, mas que se cumprem se não forem observados seus avisos – é claro que, quando podem ser evitadas.
O mundo causal é privilégio das grandes almas. É a região do conhecimento causal, do nirvana. São necessários duros trabalhos evolutivos para se chegar a este plano.
A LUZ que obscureceu em “Vô” Binah, agora resplandece em “Vô” Tiphereth porque o um e positivo e o dois negativos e a alternância faz parte do ciclo da criação.
Ao analisarmos o Arcano solar 19 (Sol) perceberemos que Qof é um Alef em estado “Vô”, senão vejamos:
Temos que:
1 => Alef em estado “Yod”
10 = 1 + 0 => Alef em estado “He”
19 = 1 + 9 =10; => 1 + 0=1 => Alef em estado “Vô” resultado de 3 decomposições. Trata-se, portanto, de uma energia solar ligada a Tiphereth.
Percebemos aqui que a junção das forças Kether-Tiphereth produz uma necessidade de harmonia tão forte que ultrapassa as próprias necessidades individuais e expressa um desejo de viver em paz com todo mundo e mais que isto que o outro também se liberte e seja feliz.
Como estamos tratando das energias de Kether-Tiphereth, é fácil concluir que o afã de viver em paz com todos não se trata de um estado pacífico, mas um fazer aos demais o que deseja que lhes façam, o que pressupõe a atividade, o impulso de Kether.
“Mateus 7:12 Portanto, tudo o que vós quereis que os homens vos façam, fazei-lhos também vós assim, porque esta é a lei e os profetas.”
Este desejo de harmonia faz com que as pessoas façam concessões umas com as outras, uma abdicação de benefícios próprios em favor do outro. Uma pré-disposição a dar a cada um o que se pede.
“Mateus 5:40 e ao que quiser pleitear contigo e tirar-te a vestimenta, [túnica] larga-lhe também a capa;
Mateus 5:41 e, se qualquer te obrigar a caminhar uma légua, [milha] vai com ele duas.
Mateus 5:42 Dá a quem te pedir; e não te desvies[afastes] daquele que quiser que lhe emprestes.”

1.7       Das virtudes concedidas:
1.7.1    Cura das enfermidades
Como estamos tratando da LUZ, é fácil concluir que LELAHEL promove a cura pela cromoterapia, fazendo com que cada um dos milhares de chacras receba a frequência energética terapica que lhe corresponde.
Onde a LUZ se manifesta as trevas se dissipam.
João 1:5 “e… a luz resplandece nas trevas, e as trevas não a alcançou.”
A doença, o medo, é ausência de LUZ, de energia, que no corpo reflete o caos, o desequilibro, a desordem das células que resulta na doença.
Mesmo a LUZ artificial tem sua utilidade a noite já que mantem afastado o batalhão das sombras de nosso subconsciente que nada mais é do que o reflexo, o espelhamento do que ocorre em outros planos, mas agora passando pelo diáfano da glândula pineal, ou epífise tida como a sede da alma. Esta LUZ que penetra pela retina, que é sensível à luz, serve de anteparo para as imagens que posteriormente são levadas pelos nossos nervos óticos até o cérebro e posteriormente à glândula espiritual, refletem em caminho inverso ao nosso subconsciente e daí para os diversos planos que se manifesta como um raio fulminante.
A LUZ curativa procede diretamente de Kether em um raio direto que passa pelo sendeiro de número 13, representado pelo arcano 3 que que está ligado as propriedades de Binah constituidor do universo que mantém ainda a ordem no corpo físico, mas agora em um fluxo direto de Kether e com toda a bondade e harmonia relativa a Tiphereth conjuntamente às fontes Sol – Lua emanando a alma Crística – temos dessarte a operabilidade do sexto raio.
LALAHEL sendo um portador de LUZ nos ilumina a fim de que tomemos consciência das atitudes que tem bloqueada ou desarmonizadas as energias que originaram a enfermidade. Neste sentido, procede a cura dos males físicos, emocionais e mentais.
A cromoterapia utilizada para cura das doenças não é só a da luz artificial. Em uma operação de cura pode-se invocar estas cores vindas de Kether, passando por Tiphereth para dinamizar a força Crística e posteriormente dirigi-la para o órgão doente.
Pode ser emanada a energia pela imposição de mãos, muito utilizada pelos Egípcios, Roma antiga, Grécia. Ou ainda imagine uma esfera na mão esquerda (mão que recebe – simbolizando Kether – pode-se segurar um cristal esférico na mão), que capte as energias do plano superior como indicado e posteriormente esta energia se dirige para a mão direita (mão que dá) e daí para o órgão a ser sanado o reconstruído. Fixe a cor no órgão até que consiga ver toda a cor tomando conta do órgão. Visto isto a operação pode ser concluída.
Na imagem ao vemos um sacerdote a esquerda captando as energias do alto – perceba a esfera no alto de sua cabeça e ao fato de que suas mãos estão em ato de receber. Uma pessoa no meio de dois sacerdotes que destilam a energia em direção ao do meio. Do lado direito Hórus e do lado esquerdo provavelmente Hermanubs. Ambos apontam com suas mãos o símbolo sacerdotal e condutor de energia composto dos dedos polegar, médio e anular esticados formando o pentagrama, a estrela de cinco pontas. A frente da mão de Hórus vemos o símbolo das energias cristificadas – a ansata egípcia. Os três estão de mãos dadas (lembre-se sempre que a esquerda recebe e a direita dá) indicando uma força em cadeia cujos dois polos apontam para aquele que está no meio, fecha-se assim um circuito energético.
Fique atento ao que vê e sente internamente durante a prática, pois como o Médico está se ligando energeticamente ao paciente, verá e sentira o que ocorre com o mesmo e com o órgão a ser trabalhado.
Lembre-se sempre de baixar as energias do alto ao invés de utilizar as suas para não ficar esgotado. É claro que as energias que fluem pelo organismo do Médico o beneficiam também.
Pode-se curar desta forma as pessoas mesmo sem que elas saibam e sem que sejam tocadas fisicamente. As energias de Tiphereth são as do mais puro amor.
Vejamos algumas cores e seus efeitos internos e externos:
1.7.1.1 Cor verde:
O verde encontra-se em toda natureza, é a cor da fotossíntese, ou seja, a cristalização física dos raios solares. Na baba da babosa encontramos um dos substratos mais perfeitos deste processo, aliás, muito bom par as doenças de pele, pois absorve o excesso de elemento fogo. Na natureza tudo se desenvolve mediante os raios solares que também tem conexão com o elemento fogo. É a cor do verão, carregado de energia vital. Sua utilização é praticamente universal.
Serve para regeneração e recuperação das células, órgãos, tecidos, infecções, antissepsia, regular o fluxo menstrual quando atrasado.
1.7.1.2 Cor azul
Está ligada ao elemento ar, a primavera. Possui propriedades calmantes, sedantes, algumas pessoas utilizam esta cor para as mesmas situações da cor verde. Esta cor tem muita relação com Hesed, daí sua função tranquilizadora.
Pode-se utilizá-la para insónia.
Evite utilizar esta cor em pessoas depressivas, aliás, neste caso ainda, afaste-as ainda de cores escuras tendentes ao negro. Isto vale dizer a roupas, moveis etc.
1.7.1.3 Cor amarela:
A cor amarela tem muita correspondência com o estado mental, com a mente. É favorável para utilização em salas de meditação.
No corpo físico sua cor está diretamente relacionada ao caroteno, portanto tem muita relação na cura com as doenças de pele.
1.7.1.4 Cor vermelha
Trata-se de uma cor repleta de energia e vitalidade e atua beneficamente neste sentido. Também tem relação com o elemento fogo, com o verão. Esta cor pode ser utilizada no auxílio de pessoas depressivas, anêmicas e toda doença que denote falta de energia. Auxilia ainda no fluxo sanguíneo e pode também ser utilizada para a regularização do fluxo menstrual.
1.7.1.5 Cor violeta:
Trata-se de uma cor fria de uma frequência bastante elevada que nos permite fazer boas viagens mentais a planos superiores de consciência.
Auxilia na cura das dores de cabeça e enxaquecas. Neste caso pode-se utilizar como auxiliar a pedra ametista para a cura caso seja por falta de sincronia entre o corpo físico e astral. Adormeça e ao acordar estará curada.
Caso persista utilize a turmalina negra pois o problema e inverso.
Outras cores podem ainda ser utilizadas. Solicite orientação ao Gênio, lembre-se inclusive de invocá-lo nas operações.
Outros Gênios trabalham pela cura em operações diversas, assim em resumo temos:
1->6 LELAHEL: cura pela cromoterapia e consciência dos atos danosos;
3->8 MELAHEL: cura mediante utilização das plantas medicinais, energias, cirurgias, pesquisas;
4->7 OMAEL: Cura o efeito das doenças pelos medicamentos;
5->8 REHAEL: Cura de doenças mentais relativa a relação Pai-filho e mantém a saúde pela maneira correta de pensar;
6->6 SEALIAH: Cura mediante o equilíbrio e a boa distribuição do sangue – o Tiphereth genuíno;
7->4 HAHASIAH: Cura pela compreensão do mal – cura a causa da doença;
8->5 MITZRAEL: Cura às enfermidades mentais, oriundas dos desejos: drogas, homossexualismo;
8->8 ANAUEL: Cura pela superação das emoções e desejos, altera-se a relação causa e efeito;
9->5 HABUHIAH: Cura eliminando hábitos nocivos – harmonia com universo – ñ vida dupla.
1.7.1     Iluminação espiritual
Tiphereth-Sol é a séfira que transmite mais LUZ na arvore da vida. Abro um parênteses para dizer que embora estejamos tratando da arvore da ciência do bem e do mal, falamos também da arvore da vida, já que as energias que saem de Kether, percorrem todas as séfiras até desaguar em Malkuth, contudo, depois de estar em Malkuth percorrem um caminho inverso com vistas à Kether; desta forma podemos trata-la como arvore da vida também muito embora este termo refira-se mais as energias que nos elevam a categoria de Deuses quando direcionadas corretamente, o que é feito também pela utilização da consciência em obediência as normas de Yod-He-Vô-He.
Esta LUZ ilumina o entendimento que permite desenvolver nossa consciência. Cabe esclarecer que consciência é energia, alma é energia. LELALEL nos ajudará a valorar o que está bem e o que não está, o bem e o mal são colocados na balança em todas as situações passando pelo crivo da consciência nos permitindo compreender as coisas em suas medidas exatas, justas.
A LUZ equilibrada produz a PAZ que nos inclina ás altas ciências, aquelas que ultrapassam os nossos cinco sentidos em busca do oculto das coisas, então buscamos a filosofia (supra materialista, supra intelectualista), metafísica, a física quântica, a astrologia energética, o conhecimento pela concentração, pela meditação, pela osmose com tudo quanto exista, vamos as ruinas e utilizamos uma pedra como link para acessarmos os registros Akáshicos da natureza e nos acercarmos de tudo o que ocorreu ali.
1.7.2    Renome e fortuna nas ciências e nas artes
A pessoa nascida sob sua influência gostará de ser conhecida e alcançará a celebridade por seus talentos e suas ações.
Acumulando em nosso interior esta essência chamada LUZ, suscitaremos a aparição de outras faculdades. Já vimos que onde a Luz há AMOR e do mesmo modo podemos afirmar que esta mesma LUZ suscita o renome.
Quem possui a essência chamada LUZ não precisa se preocupar com o futuro, eis que será descoberto e situado em seu lugar correspondente na sociedade segundo a hierarquia de valores internos.
“Mateus 6:29 e seguintes: Atentei[Olhai] para os lírios do campo, como eles crescem; não trabalham, nem fiam.
E eu vos digo que nem mesmo[ainda] Salomão, com[em] toda a sua glória, se vestiu como um deles.
Pois, se Deus assim veste a erva do campo, que hoje é[existe] e amanhã se lança no forno, não vos vestirá muito mais a vós, homens de pouca[pequena] fé?”
Estamos tratando aqui da Lei de afinidade vibratória que faz com que cada um se associe quem ou com aquilo, a mesma frequência em que vibre, seja esta frequência ética, moral, de LUZ interior. As energias tendem a se equilibrarem e cada um ocupar seu devido lugar. Então a roupagem dos lírios dos campos corresponde a vestimenta que cobre sua espécie, o exterior é a expressão de sua semente, exatamente o seu nível de Ser e a fé passa a ser o conhecimento daquilo que é em sua essência e, já não havendo mais conflito ou dúvida em seu interior a cada um é dado seu lugar correspondente e se ainda não o é dado sabe com certeza o que lhe espera.
O acúmulo da essência LUZ proporciona felicidade inclusive aos que rodeiam quem a possui. Será próspero e saberá utilizar seus sentidos para tirar o máximo de proveito em abundante inspiração e as marcas anímicas de tudo quanto faça trará o selo da harmonia, do bem-estar.
Sabendo-se que LUZ significa entendimento, sua posse proporcionara o entendimento das ciências do mundo e as saberemos interpretaras com a graça e arte que Tiphereth, a sephira central que se comunica com todas as outras, nos proporciona.
Aqueles que não possuem a LUZ interior, precisam encarecidamente, aprender as ciências nas universidades para compreender as obscuridades, os subterrâneos do mundo. Mas os iluminados por LELAHEL compreendem profundamente as ciências do mundo e dominaram a arte de expressá-las.
Para os iluminados o ouro físico, falando na linguagem dos alquimistas, não é mais que uma condensação da LUZ de modo que quem a possui em seu interior acaba encontrando o ouro, ainda que por vezes tarde a chegar deixando impaciente o cliente de LELAHEL.
Se trabalharmos no entendimento, na compreensão do mundo a fortuna aparecerá em um momento ou outro porque os frutos são o resultado de uma atividade por vezes longamente desenvolvida.
A pessoa que nasce sob a influência deste Gênio amara a difusão de sua imagem em razão de seus talentos e ações e desta forma tornar-se á celebre. Mas tudo ocorrerá como uma consequência natural da evolução de sua LUZ interna.
No mais, as pessoas que carregam em si a essência chamada LUZ, em um momento ou outro sentem a necessidade de derramá-la. Contudo esta essência possui uma inteligência e uma Vontade e este derramar é algo que vem da própria LUZ que se derrama por si só; então quem a possui em verdade, também, é possuído, em uma unidade, de forma que a Vontade de difusão e algo que ultrapassa a pessoa que acredita possuir a essência enquanto de fato ambos se tornam “Um”.
Com base no que acabamos de descrever podemos compreender que este Gênio não concede amor, renome, ciência, fortuna tudo de uma vez, mas, o concede de forma escalonada e a fortuna vem por último depois dos três períodos de trabalho como tudo que é feito na ordem de Jehovah => Yod-He-Vô-He.
Outros Gênios que concedem o renome.
1-6 LELAHEL Renome nas ciências e nas artes advindas da LUZ.
2-4 LAUVIAH Renome por talento próprio.
3->7 YEIAIEL: Renome para submeter os demais e no comércio.
7->9 POYEL: Renome providencial, por meios naturais.
9->6 ROCHEL: Renome provindo de legados.
Outros gênios que atraem a fortuna:
1->6 LELAHEL: Fortuna natural como resultado de um trabalho realizado;
3->7 YEIAIEL: Proporciona a fortuna pelo renome, boa imagem, divulgação;
4->8 LECABEL: Fortuna em razão do talento natural;
6->7 ARIEL: Descoberta de um filão inesgotável;
7->9 POYEL: Fortuna em razão do talento e conduta;
8->4 HARAHEL: Talento na bolsa de valores, especulações benéficas;
9->2 DAMABIAH: Fortuna por uma descoberta.
1.7.3    O amor de uma pessoa afortunada
Se mediante a LUZ entendemos as coisas, a nossa LUZ interior fará com que as outras pessoas entendam a nós também, nos compreendam, nos amem.
Tiphereth induz ao amor que dá de forma incondicional as energias provenientes de Kether, a emanação primordial e infinita o que acarreta um fluxo de bondade provindo diretamente da fonte.
É a nossa claridade interna que suscita o amor das pessoas com quem cruzamos. Do mesmo modo que as pessoas amam a pedra preciosa como o diamante por sua LUZ e estão dispostos a pagar um preço muito elevado, assim ocorrerá conosco.
Disto resulta a fórmula: Onde há LUZ há AMOR.
1.7.4    Proteção contra a ambição desmensurada e a cobiça.
O lado negativo da força
O gênio contrário domina a ambição; leva os homens a querer elevarem-se acima dos outros; influi sobre todos os que procuram alcançar a fortuna por meios ilícitos.
Se as forças de Tiphereth trata da filantropia, da doação ao próximo sua contraparte negativa cuidará da ambição doentia (saltar etapas) e da cobiça (de querer o que pertence a outrem) levada a termo pela perversa inversão das forças de Kether.
Em nossa sociedade as pessoa tidas como ambiciosa são muito bem vistas e até querida pelas empresas que pretendem ter um monstro em sua coleira para poder tirar vantagens. Quem não tem ambições é considerado como cidadão de segunda linha.
Aqui podemos perceber que a ambição sendo a contraparte negativa de Tiphereth trata-se de uma “qualidade” promovida pelas hostes abismais.
Se possuímos uma empresa, os produtos estão marcados animicamente, de forma invisível o caráter de quem os produz, vende. Se são elaborados com o ódio dos empregados, a cobiça excessiva a ponto de se importar apenas em receber ou ainda outras impressões danosas tudo isto será detectado pela clientela. Inicialmente a nível subconsciente e posteriormente passando-se ao consciente até que de alguma forma o artigo seja rechaçado, objeto de demandas judiciais, etc.
Como, por um instante, estamos tratando do lado negativo, o empresário manifestará uma vontade de ignorância e negação, o oposto da vontade-luz cabalisticamente chamada de Kether-Tiphereth. Se produzirá uma vontade sinistra pelo aumento dos gozos sem medir as consequências. Assim as atitudes passam a ser a de ignorar as reivindicações de seus funcionários, os clientes são ludibriados, a redução de custos e aumento de preços sem retorno no produto. Como consequência a empresa embarcará em uma guerra comercial e laboral e colocará em jogo todas as más qualidades que possui para ganhar a guerra até que por fim mergulhe em um abismo do qual se enfiou e não consegue sair. Como a Lei da polaridade está em tudo, após o mergulho abismal surgirá o afã de viver em PAZ.
A ambição (e porque não dizer: ganância?)  traduz-se por querer ser mais do que se é, em elevar-se acima de uma condição humana determinada sem haver adquirido as qualidades que lhe situa de forma automática naquele nível, contrariando a ordem natural, o que não é permitido, o que ocasionara, uma ora ou outra, o repique das forças naturais que afetam tanto a matéria como a psique.
Se a vida nos situa em um determinado plano devemos nos mover para alcançar outros níveis, isto faz parte da evolução. Contudo a maneira natural e subir degrau por degrau, com os esforços e tensões relativos a cada ponto e nos fortaleceremos em etapas sucessivas em uma elevação com bases sólidas e firmes.
O ambicioso é aquele que não se contentando com o nível em que está pretende viver em outro nível sem haver adquirido as qualidades humanas que lhe situa automaticamente no nível a que pretende.
O ambicioso como define muito bem Kabaleb: “é como o alpinista que estando em um vale deseja estar no cume da montanha sem se dar a modéstia de escalá-la”.
E da ambição e da cobiça que surgem os roubos, o tráfico de drogas etc.
Somente o trabalho humano, o trabalho sobre si nos permite ascender. A vida nos situa automaticamente no ponto onde devemos estar.
Assim, podemos concluir que trabalho é o oposto de ambição. A ambição pretende tomar um atalho ao trabalho. E, tomar um atalho do trabalho, significa operar por meios ilícitos. Pretendem conseguir o ouro, mas sem fabricá-lo em sua dinâmica interna.
Contudo a fortuna pode ser adquirida por meios lícitos. Inicialmente temos que plantar a semente, cuidar dela, regá-la, fazer um trabalho de persistência e então Águardar que a planta surja e seus frutos apareçam – esta é a dinâmica Yod-He-Vô-He, do misterioso nome impronunciável.
O tempo de retorno dependerá do que pretendemos. Se plantamos verduras, hortaliças estas estarão prontas para colheita em cerca de um mês, mas se tratando de madeira de Lei, podem demorar décadas, contudo seus frutos são tão duradores quanto o cerne.
Uma obra pode demorar muito a se arraigar e dar seus frutos dependendo do que se pretende colher.
Deste modo podemos concluir que os meios ilícitos são aqueles que instam que uma obra grande se realize em um curto espaço de tempo. Contudo esta obra, ilícita, não subsistira porquanto não seguiu as etapas “Yod-He-Vô-He” (plantação, enraizamento, brotação/desenvolvimento e frutificação.
Para terminar, vale ressaltar que LELAHEL ajuda-nos a vencermos a ambição é a cobiça que levamos em nosso interior para, assim, atuarmos por meios lícitos.
1.8       Escrituras
“S 9:11 (9-12) Cantate Domino habitatori Sion adnuntiate in populis commutationes eius.
Cantai ao Eterno que habita em Sião; anunciai entre os povos os seus Altos Feitos.”
1.9        Oração
LELAHEL: Deus louvável
LELAHEL: Agradeço-lhe, Senhor
por esta paragem ao longo do caminho que me ofereceis.
Permita-me LELAHEL, compartilhar com meus irmãos
as abundantes bênçãos com as quais me haveis rodeado.
Inspira-me, Senhor, o desejo de curar aos enfermos,
o desejo de restabelecer e equilibrar as almas em crise.
Se devo deixar minhas memórias no mundo, permita-me, Oh! Senhor LELAHEL!, que se me recordem por minhas obras de bondade, de filantropia e desprendimento e
que minha ambição se limite a ser o portador de soluções felizes para todos.
Que o amor que inspiro, seja, Senhor, o amor que inspirais,
que a ciência que saia de mim, seja Vossa ciência;
que a arte que expresse, seja a de Vosso Verbo divino.
1.10    Exortação
Tenho lhe concedido poderes para criar,
para que por meio de ti se expressem verdades eternas;
Tenho lhe concedido poderes para que restabeleças aquilo que teus irmãos,
em sua humana viagem pela terra tem destruído, tornado obsoleto e impossível.
Quero que por meio de ti os homens vivam felizes;
quero que os confortes, que os cure;
quero que em tua luz, vejam a Minha Luz.
Para que sejas um farol nesse caminho árduo da conquista da consciência.
Tenho lhe concedido a capacidade para a arte e para a ciência,
tenho feiro de ti um homem célebre.
Não me defraudes, nem utilizes este capital em teu exclusivo proveito.
Amanhã te esperam duras confrontações
e o bem que distribuis agora ao teu redor será tua tábua de salvação.
Peregrino, te encontras no momento difícil das lisonjas, das honras, das vitórias
das quais necessitarás de toda a sua força da alma para não se corromper na caminhada.
Mantenha o contato comigo, não te prescindas da fonte de luz eterna.
Oração e exortação de Kabaleb.

Como entrar com ações contra o exame de ordem da OAB? Não há como sustentar a exclusão de +++ 4 MILHÕES +++ de bacharéis de direito que estão fora do mercado de trabalho em virtude do corporativismo, de uma confraria e da reserva de mercado. Este número é absurdo e só tende a aumentar. Para tudo explodir é uma questão de tempo… Milhares de bacharéis estão entrando com as ações.
Na barra a direita e acima possuimos uma Categoria completa, com materiais relativo aos exames de ordem - Decisões - Modelos de petições - Projetos de Lei - e muita matéria do que vem ocorrendo DIVULGUE este material...
Quem sai prejudicado? R. A população mais carente que não pode ter acesso a justiça em virtude do auto custo de um advogado...
Quem defende este exame? R. -> A OAB, advogados que terão que dividir o pão com mais de 4 MILHÕES de Bacharéis que se tornarão Advogados...
Eles lutarão até o último suspiro para que isto não ocorra, mas nos continuaremos lutando quando não houver mais suspiro...

Perfeito. Vou preparar um relatório completo sobre as dignidades planetárias segundo a astrologia hermética, com explicações técnicas detalhadas. O conteúdo será em português brasileiro e incluirá tabelas e fundamentos teóricos conforme essa tradição esotérica. Em breve trarei o material para sua revisão.

Dignidades Planetárias na Astrologia Hermética

Dignidades Planetárias na Astrologia Hermética: Relatório Técnico
=================================================================

Introdução e Conceitos Gerais
-----------------------------

A astrologia **hermética** fundamenta-se na ideia de correspondência entre o macrocosmo e o microcosmo – ou seja, entre os corpos celestes e a experiência humana na Terra[pt.wikipedia.org](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetismo#:~:text=1,vida%20como%20%20120%20pessoal). Nessa tradição esotérica inspirada no _Corpus Hermeticum_ e no neoplatonismo, cada planeta clássico (de Saturno à Lua) é visto como um princípio cósmico que se manifesta tanto no mundo material quanto no espiritual[pt.wikipedia.org](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetismo#:~:text=divino%20na%20natureza%20humana,30). Os astrólogos herméticos atribuem aos planetas certas “dignidades” ou posições de força e fraqueza nos signos do zodíaco, refletindo uma ordem universal harmônica. Esse sistema de dignidades planetárias – herdado da astrologia helenística e desenvolvido por pensadores hermetistas e neoplatônicos em Alexandria[ozigurate.com.br](https://ozigurate.com.br/2021/04/12/sete-corpos-do-ser-humano/#:~:text=Em%20Alexandria%2C%20no%20Egito%20helenizado%2C,Romano%20at%C3%A9%20o%20subcontinente%20indiano) – estabelece critérios claros para avaliar o **poder** ou **qualidade** de um planeta em um mapa astrológico, de forma técnica e objetiva[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Image%3A%20PtolomeuA%20for%C3%A7a%20relativa%20de,os%20%C3%A2ngulos%20da%20carta%20etc).

**Dignidades essenciais** são assim chamadas porque dependem exclusivamente da posição do planeta no zodíaco (ou seja, em qual signo e grau ele se encontra). Elas indicam quão bem a natureza intrínseca do planeta se expressa naquele setor do céu[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=por%20ele%20ocupada,os%20%C3%A2ngulos%20da%20carta%20etc). Em contrapartida, as **dignidades acidentais** dependem de fatores circunstanciais do mapa – por exemplo, a posição por casa astrológica (angular, sucedente ou cadente), o movimento (direto ou retrógrado, rápido ou lento), a relação com o Sol (combusto ou não), os aspectos que o planeta forma com outros astros ou estrelas fixas, entre outros fatores externos[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=por%20ele%20ocupada,os%20%C3%A2ngulos%20da%20carta%20etc)[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Sobre%20as%20dignidades%20essenciais%20e,%C3%A2ngulos%20do%20mapa%20e%20etc). Este relatório abordará em detalhes ambos os tipos: primeiro definiremos as dignidades essenciais (e suas debilidades opostas), com tabelas tradicionais ilustrando os planetas em seus signos de força e fraqueza; em seguida, explicaremos as dignidades acidentais e sua relevância. Também discutiremos as origens herméticas dessas ideias – incluindo influências do _Corpus Hermeticum_, da filosofia neoplatônica e suas ligações com a **Cabala** e a **Alquimia**. Por fim, veremos como aplicar esses conceitos na interpretação de mapas natais e eleitorais, de forma prática e técnica.

Dignidades Essenciais: Domicílio, Exaltação, Triplicidade, Termos e Faces
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

As dignidades essenciais clássicas são cinco: **Domicílio**, **Exaltação**, **Triplicidade**, **Termos** (ou **Limites**) e **Faces** (ou \*\*Decanatos)[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=S%C3%A3o%20dignidades%20essenciais%3A%20domic%C3%ADlio%2C%20exalta%C3%A7%C3%A3o%2C,triplicidade%2C%20termo%20e%20face). Cada uma indica um nível de afinidade entre planeta e signo, hierarquizados por potência: o domicílio é a dignidade mais forte, seguido da exaltação; a triplicidade confere um poder moderado; os termos e faces são dignidades menores[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=S%C3%A3o%20dignidades%20essenciais%3A%20domic%C3%ADlio%2C%20exalta%C3%A7%C3%A3o%2C,triplicidade%2C%20termo%20e%20face). Quando um planeta está em alguma dessas dignidades, diz-se que ele está **fortalecido** ou **dignificado** – ou seja, pode expressar seus significados de modo fluido e eficaz. Veremos cada dignidade a seguir:

### Domicílio (Regência) e Exílio (Detrimento)

**Domicílio** – Também chamada **regência**, é a dignidade essencial mais importante[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Sistematizando%20o%20conhecimento%20astrol%C3%B3gico%20que,pouco%20estudadas%20pelos%20astr%C3%B3logos%20modernos)[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=S%C3%A3o%20dignidades%20essenciais%3A%20domic%C3%ADlio%2C%20exalta%C3%A7%C3%A3o%2C,triplicidade%2C%20termo%20e%20face). Um planeta está em seu domicílio quando se encontra no signo que ele governa naturalmente. Nessa posição, o planeta atua como se estivesse “em casa”, pois há máxima afinidade entre suas qualidades e as do signo[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Regente%20%E2%80%93%20O%20regente%20%C3%A9,de%20maneira%20mais%20direta%20e). Por exemplo, Marte rege Áries; logo Marte em Áries está domiciliado, manifestando sua energia de maneira direta e fortalecida, com grande iniciativa e capacidade de ação[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Regente%20%E2%80%93%20O%20regente%20%C3%A9,de%20maneira%20mais%20direta%20e)astrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Cada planeta tradicional rege um ou dois signos: com exceção do Sol e da Lua (que regem apenas Leão e Câncer respectivamente, por serem luminares), os demais têm dois domicílios – um de expressão diurna (yang, masculino) e outro de expressão noturna (yin, feminino)[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=s%C3%A9culo%20XVII%2C%20com%20exclus%C3%A3o%20dos,e%20yin%2C%20extrovertido%20e%20introvertido). Por exemplo, Saturno é regente diurno de Aquário e noturno de Capricórnio; Marte rege diurnamente Áries e noturnamente Escorpião, manifestando-se de modo mais extrovertido no primeiro e mais introspectivo no segundo[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=s%C3%A9culo%20XVII%2C%20com%20exclus%C3%A3o%20dos,e%20yin%2C%20extrovertido%20e%20introvertido).

Quando um planeta está no signo oposto ao seu domicílio, ele fica em **Exílio** – termo equivalente a **Detrimento** – que é considerado uma **debilidade essencial**[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Detrimento%20ou%20Ex%C3%ADlio%3A%20dizemos%20que,com%20algum%20setor%20da%20vida). No exílio, o planeta está em terreno alheio, onde as qualidades do signo oposto “não compreendem ou combinam” bem com sua natureza[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Detrimento%20ou%20Ex%C3%ADlio%3A%20dizemos%20que,com%20algum%20setor%20da%20vida). Por exemplo, Vênus em Áries (signo oposto a Libra, que Vênus rege) está em exílio, indicando dificuldades em expressar sua suavidade num signo tão impetuoso; Saturno em Câncer (oposto a Capricórnio, seu domicílio) também está exilado, encontrando limitações para manifestar sua disciplina em um signo emocional[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Detrimento%20ou%20Ex%C3%ADlio%3A%20dizemos%20que,com%20algum%20setor%20da%20vida). Um planeta em detrimento tende a operar de forma menos eficiente, prometendo resultados instáveis ou esforços maiores para cumprir seus significadosastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Detrimento%20ou%20Ex%C3%ADlio%3A%20dizemos%20que,com%20algum%20setor%20da%20vida). Ainda assim, essa fraqueza pode ser atenuada por outros fatores do mapa – como aspectos benéficos ou regências compartilhadas – de modo que não se deve “fazer um grande drama”: exílio indica desafios, não condenação absoluta[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=encontra,com%20algum%20setor%20da%20vida).

Na tabela abaixo, resumimos os domicílios e exílios dos planetas tradicionais, juntamente com suas exaltações e quedas (ver próxima seção). Observe que utilizamos apenas os regentes clássicos (até Saturno), conforme a prática hermética e tradicional[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=domic%C3%ADlio%29.%20Considera,Marte%20manifesta%20sua%20energia%20de):

_(Notas: Os graus de exaltação listados indicam o ponto de máxima força dentro do signo exaltado[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=e%20da%20energia,A). Por exemplo, 19° de Áries é onde o Sol atinge sua exaltação máxima. Mesmo assim, qualquer grau dentro daquele signo ainda confere a dignidade da exaltação ao planeta. Além disso, Mercúrio possui uma situação especial em Virgem, onde é simultaneamente regente e exaltado. Planetas modernos (Urano, Netuno, Plutão) não são considerados na astrologia hermética tradicional, que se baseia apenas nos sete astros visíveis a olho nu[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Regente%20%E2%80%93%20O%20regente%20%C3%A9,Escorpi%C3%A3o%2C%20mas%20em%20%C3%81ries%2C%20sua).)_

### Exaltação e Queda

**Exaltação** – É a segunda dignidade essencial em importância. Dizemos que um planeta está exaltado quando posicionado em um signo onde sua natureza encontra uma expressão extremamente compatível e elevada, ainda que não seja seu domicílio[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Exalta%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20%E2%80%93%20Al%C3%A9m%20do%20signo,est%C3%A1%20%C3%A0%20vontade%20e%2C%20consequentemente)[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Exalta%C3%A7%C3%A3o%3A%C2%A0aqui%20o%20planeta%20n%C3%A3o%20est%C3%A1,se%20exaltada%20em%20qualquer). O termo sugere que ali o planeta é “honrado” pelo signo, quase como um convidado de honra recebendo tratamento especial do anfitrião[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Exalta%C3%A7%C3%A3o%3A%C2%A0aqui%20o%20planeta%20n%C3%A3o%20est%C3%A1,expressa%20bem%20%C3%A0%20sua%20maneira). Por exemplo, Saturno rege Capricórnio e Aquário (seus lares), mas encontra sua exaltação em Libra[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Exalta%C3%A7%C3%A3o%3A%C2%A0aqui%20o%20planeta%20n%C3%A3o%20est%C3%A1,expressa%20bem%20%C3%A0%20sua%20maneira). Libra, sendo um signo de ar equilibrado e sociável, acolhe as qualidades de Saturno (ordem, justiça, estrutura) de forma harmoniosa, permitindo a Saturno expressar seu melhor potencial nesse contexto[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Exalta%C3%A7%C3%A3o%3A%C2%A0aqui%20o%20planeta%20n%C3%A3o%20est%C3%A1,se%20exaltada%20em%20qualquer). Outro exemplo: o Sol, que rege Leão, está exaltado em Áries – signo de fogo cardinal, dinâmico e corajoso, que realça o brilho e a vitalidade solar[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Exalta%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20%E2%80%93%20Al%C3%A9m%20do%20signo,est%C3%A1%20%C3%A0%20vontade%20e%2C%20consequentemente). Um planeta exaltado tende a operar de modo **eficaz e notável**, frequentemente indicando acontecimentos grandiosos ou virtudes exaltadas (embora tais eventos possam ser tanto positivos quanto desafiadores, pois a exaltação às vezes implica excessos)astrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com.

Por sua vez, quando um planeta está no signo oposto ao de sua exaltação, ele se encontra em **Queda** – outra debilidade essencial. A queda representa praticamente o inverso simbólico da exaltação: é como se o planeta “caísse do pedestal” naquele signo, enfrentando dificuldades e desconfortos na expressão de sua natureza[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Queda%3A%20dizemos%20que%20um%20planeta,uma%20dignidade%20maior). Se a exaltação é honra, a queda é humilhação. Por exemplo, enquanto Saturno é exaltado em Libra, no signo oposto Áries ele está em queda[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Queda%3A%20dizemos%20que%20um%20planeta,uma%20dignidade%20maior). Áries, com sua impaciência e individualismo, não fornece suporte às qualidades saturninas de prudência e planejamento – logo Saturno em Áries sente-se enfraquecido e com “dificuldade de entendimento”, assim como ocorre no detrimento[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Queda%3A%20dizemos%20que%20um%20planeta,uma%20dignidade%20maior). Em termos comparativos, considera-se o detrimento (exílio) uma debilidade ligeiramente mais grave que a queda – nas pontuações tradicionais, um planeta em detrimento perde 5 pontos, ao passo que em queda perde 4[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=sua%20exalta%C3%A7%C3%A3o%2C%20logo%2C%20se%20Saturno,uma%20dignidade%20maior). Mas ambos indicam fragilidade e carência de auxílio naquele signo[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Queda%3A%20dizemos%20que%20um%20planeta,uma%20dignidade%20maior).

_Diagrama das **Exaltações Planetárias** segundo a tradição: cada símbolo planetário está posicionado em seu signo de exaltação, junto do grau considerado de exaltação máxima. Observa-se, por exemplo, o símbolo do Sol exaltado em Áries (grau 19°), a Lua exaltada em Touro (3°), Júpiter em Câncer (15°), etc. Todo o signo proporciona dignidade de exaltação ao planeta indicado (não apenas o grau exato), mas esses graus realçam o ponto de auge da força. No total, sete planetas possuem exaltações clássicas, deixando alguns signos “sem planeta exaltado” – por exemplo, Gêmeos, Leão, Escorpião e Sagitário não têm exaltação planetária tradicional (algumas fontes medievais atribuem exaltações aos Nodos Lunares nesses signos, mas sem consenso ou eficácia comprovada)[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=e%20da%20energia,A)._[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Exalta%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20%E2%80%93%20Al%C3%A9m%20do%20signo,planeta%20se%20exalta%20em%20cada)[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=signo.%20Inclui,efic%C3%A1cia%20de%20seu%20uso%20pr%C3%A1tico)

### Triplicidade (Trígono)

**Triplicidade** é a terceira dignidade essencial em poder. Refere-se aos _elementos_ dos signos: Fogo, Terra, Ar e Água. Cada triplicidade (grupo de três signos do mesmo elemento) possui regentes planetários tradicionais, que conferem certa dignidade quando o planeta está em um signo daquele elemento[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Triplicidade%20%E2%80%93%20Os%20signos%20que,e%20J%C3%BApiter%20como%20regente%20noturno). A afinidade aqui é elementar: signos de fogo, por exemplo, compartilham uma base ígnea que se alinha com a natureza de determinados planetas. A dignidade de triplicidade é mais sutil – “não tão poderosa quanto domicílio e exaltação” –, mas ainda indica uma **compreensão parcial** entre o planeta e o signo que ajuda na expressão dos assuntos daquele planeta[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Triplicidade%3A%C2%A0comp%C3%B5em%20a%20mesma%20triplicidade%20os,de%20Virgem%20%C3%A9%20a%20Lua). Importante: os regentes de triplicidade mudam conforme a **sect** do mapa, isto é, se o mapa é diurno (Sol acima do horizonte) ou noturno (Sol abaixo do horizonte)[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Triplicidade%20%E2%80%93%20Os%20signos%20que,e%20J%C3%BApiter%20como%20regente%20noturno)[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Triplicidade%3A%C2%A0comp%C3%B5em%20a%20mesma%20triplicidade%20os,de%20Virgem%20%C3%A9%20a%20Lua). Assim, cada elemento tem um governante de triplicidade para mapas diurnos e outro para mapas noturnos – refletindo a diferença de expressão sob luz solar ou noturna.

Seguem os regentes tradicionais de triplicidade por elemento, segundo a astrologia hermética (sistema derivado de Doroteu de Sidon, adotado por Ptolomeu e outros autores clássicos):

*   **Fogo** (Áries, Leão, Sagitário): regente diurno – **Sol**; regente noturno – **Júpiter**[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=natureza%20diurna%20da%20carta%20,e%20J%C3%BApiter%20como%20regente%20noturno). (Em mapas diurnos de fogo, o Sol reforça a identidade e vitalidade; em mapas noturnos, Júpiter traz benevolência e expansão a esses signos de fogo).
    
*   **Terra** (Touro, Virgem, Capricórnio): regente diurno – **Vênus**; regente noturno – **Lua**[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Triplicidade%3A%C2%A0comp%C3%B5em%20a%20mesma%20triplicidade%20os,de%20Virgem%20%C3%A9%20a%20Lua). (Vênus, durante o dia, enfatiza a fertilidade e harmonia dos signos de terra; à noite, a Lua acentua seu caráter nutritivo e instintivo).
    
*   **Ar** (Gêmeos, Libra, Aquário): regente diurno – **Saturno**; regente noturno – **Mercúrio**. (Saturno de dia empresta estrutura e racionalidade aos signos de ar; Mercúrio à noite intensifica a intelectualidade e versatilidade).
    
*   **Água** (Câncer, Escorpião, Peixes): regente diurno – **Vênus**; regente noturno – **Marte**. (Durante o dia, Vênus suaviza e busca união nas águas emocionais; à noite, Marte confere energia e profundidade de desejo aos signos de água). _Vale notar:_ algumas tradições dão à Água os regentes invertidos (Marte de dia, Vênus à noite) e incluem a **Lua** como participante, mas o esquema acima é comumente utilizado em contextos herméticos e pelos astrólogos árabes medievais, enfatizando Vênus/Lua para Terra e Vênus/Marte para Água[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Triplicidade%3A%C2%A0comp%C3%B5em%20a%20mesma%20triplicidade%20os,de%20Virgem%20%C3%A9%20a%20Lua)[lincosastrology.com](https://www.lincosastrology.com/post/the-confused-triplicity-doctrine#:~:text=The%20Confused%20Triplicity%20Doctrine%20,Venus%2C%20Mars%20and%20Moon%2C).
    

Estar “na própria triplicidade” concede ao planeta cerca de 1/3 do poder de um domicílio. Por exemplo, a Lua em um signo de água (digamos, Lua em Peixes em um mapa noturno) está dignificada por triplicidade, pois Peixes é do elemento Água e à noite Vênus é regente de água – porém a Lua também rege Câncer, outro signo de água, então ela se sente relativamente à vontade em Peixes devido à afinidade elemental. Essa dignidade sugere algum suporte ao planeta, ainda que moderado. Em contrapartida, um planeta fora de sua triplicidade (em signo de elemento estranho) carece até desse apoio básico – é um dos fatores que contribuem para a condição de _peregrino_, como veremos adianteastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com.

### Termos (Limites)

**Termos** são uma dignidade essencial de ordem inferior, porém ainda significativa na abordagem tradicional e hermética[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Termos%20%E2%80%93%20Trata,com%20tradu%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20de%20Barbara%20Abramo)[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Barbara%20acrescenta%20que%20termo%20vem,traduzido%20como%20circunscri%C3%A7%C3%A3o%2C%20delimita%C3%A7%C3%A3o%2C%20territ%C3%B3rio). Consistem em subdivisões dentro de cada signo – geralmente cinco segmentos de graus, cada qual regido por um planeta específico. Os termos são muitas vezes chamados de _limites_ ou _fronteiras_ (do grego _horion_), pois demarcam “territórios” planetários dentro do signo[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Barbara%20acrescenta%20que%20termo%20vem,traduzido%20como%20circunscri%C3%A7%C3%A3o%2C%20delimita%C3%A7%C3%A3o%2C%20territ%C3%B3rio). A lógica é: um planeta posicionado nos termos de outro está, por assim dizer, **sob a jurisdição daquele planeta** dentro daquele grau do zodíaco[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=,Marte%20n%C3%A3o%20seria%20t%C3%A3o%20doce). Isso colabora (ainda que de modo fraco) para a expressão do planeta ocupante. Por exemplo, se Saturno está nos termos de Vênus, diz-se que Saturno age “nos termos de Vênus” – sua influência severa é amenizada um pouco pelas qualidades venusianas do segmento em que se encontra[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=,Marte%20n%C3%A3o%20seria%20t%C3%A3o%20doce)[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Esta%20tabela%20mostra%20os%20graus,Merc%C3%BArio%2C%20e%20assim%20por%20diante). Da mesma forma, Vênus nos termos de Marte teria sua doçura tingida de marcialidade, não sendo tão suave quanto de costume[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=,Marte%20n%C3%A3o%20seria%20t%C3%A3o%20doce).

Os termos tradicionais mais usados são os chamados **Termos Egípcios**, amplamente difundidos pelos astrólogos alexandrinos e árabes. Ptolomeu propôs uma tabela ligeiramente distinta (Termos “ptolomaicos”), mas a hermética costuma aderir aos egípcios por serem considerados de origem mais antiga e mística. A estrutura geral dos Termos Egípcios é a seguinte:

*   Cada signo de 30° é dividido em 5 partes desiguais (com extensões variando entre 6° e 8° aproximadamente).
    
*   Cinco planetas tradicionais (Mercúrio, Vênus, Marte, Júpiter, Saturno) regem esses segmentos; **o Sol e a Lua não regem nenhum termo**[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Dignidades%3A%20TermosObserve%20que%20o,que).
    
*   Em geral, os planetas benéficos e neutros (Vênus, Júpiter, Mercúrio) regem os termos centrais do signo (onde estão graus 6° até ~19°), enquanto os maléficos (Marte e Saturno) regem sempre o último termo de cada signo e às vezes também o penúltimo[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Image%3A%20Dignidades%3A%20TermosObserve%20que%20o,por%20V%C3%AAnus%2C%20Merc%C3%BArio%20ou%20J%C3%BApiter). Isso significa que os graus finais de qualquer signo (aproximadamente 27°–30°) estão sob regência de um maléfico – uma antiga observação de que os finais de signo tendem a ser “dificeis”. Em contrapartida, Marte e Saturno **nunca** regem os termos intermediários (entre ~6° e ~19°), mantendo esses graus sob domínio apenas de planetas mais benéficos[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Os%20planetas%20considerados%20mal%C3%A9ficos%2C%20Marte,por%20V%C3%AAnus%2C%20Merc%C3%BArio%20ou%20J%C3%BApiter).
    

Como exemplo ilustrativo: no signo de **Áries**, os Termos Egípcios são tradicionalmente distribuídos assim – Júpiter rege de 0°00′ a 5°59′, Vênus de 6°00′ a 13°59′, Mercúrio de 14°00′ a 19°59′, Marte de 20°00′ a 25°59′, e Saturno de 26°00′ a 29°59′[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Esta%20tabela%20mostra%20os%20graus,Merc%C3%BArio%2C%20e%20assim%20por%20diante). Portanto, um planeta em Áries entre 0 e 6 graus está nos termos de Júpiter (ganha um toque de expansão/justiça jupiteriana); se estiver a 28° de Áries, está nos termos de Saturno (recebendo uma coloração saturnina daquele grau final). Embora seja uma dignidade fraca (vale 2 pontos na contagem medieval)astrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com, os termos ainda podem “salvar” um planeta de estar completamente sem dignidade. Tradicionalmente, um planeta que possua ao menos termos não é considerado totalmente peregrino.

### Faces (Decanatos)

**Faces** (do latim _facies_ = faces/semblantes) são a dignidade essencial mais **débil** de todas[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Faces%20%E2%80%93%20A%20face%20%C3%A9,planetas%20cl%C3%A1ssicos%20iniciada%20por%20Marte)[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=As%20dignidades%20acima%20est%C3%A3o%20colocadas,ent%C3%A3o%2C%20entendo%20que%20n%C3%A3o%20h%C3%A1) – valendo apenas 1 ponto na escala clássicaastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Ainda assim, têm importância simbólica especial na tradição hermética, pois se relacionam diretamente aos antigos **decanatos egípcios**, envolvidos em práticas mágico-astrológicas (talismãs, divindades decanais, etc.)[pt.wikipedia.org](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetismo#:~:text=divino%20na%20natureza%20humana,30). Cada signo do zodíaco possui 30 graus, divididos em **3 faces** de 10° cada. A cada porção de 10° associa-se um planeta regente, seguindo a sequência cíclica dos sete astros conhecida como **ordem caldaica** (de Saturno até a Lua, do mais lento ao mais rápido)[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Faces%20%E2%80%93%20A%20face%20%C3%A9,planetas%20cl%C3%A1ssicos%20iniciada%20por%20Marte). Essa sucessão reinicia a cada signo de fogo no zodíaco. Na prática, a ordem das faces começa com Marte na 1ª face de Áries e prossegue: 1ª face de Áries = Marte, 2ª = Sol, 3ª = Vênus; depois, para Touro: 1ª = Mercúrio, 2ª = Lua, 3ª = Saturno; Gêmeos: 1ª = Júpiter, 2ª = Marte, 3ª = Sol; e assim continuamente em ciclos de sete planetas. Assim, cada planeta rege uma face em quase todos os signos (exceto o par Sol-Lua, que por serem dois, completam juntos o ciclo dos sete).

Por exemplo, **Áries** tem: 0°–9°59′ regidos por Marte; 10°–19°59′ por Sol; 20°–29°59′ por Vênus[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Esta%20tabela%20mostra%20os%20graus,%C3%81ries%3B%20e%20assim%20por%20diante). Então Marte na faixa inicial de Áries está “em sua face” (pois Marte rege os primeiros 10° de Áries); já Marte nos graus 10–19 de Áries estaria na face do Sol, e assim por diante. Estar na **própria face** dá ao planeta um pequeno reforço simbólico – tão pequeno que **não torna o planeta especialmente forte**, mas serve ao menos para não deixá-lo inteiramente desamparado[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Face%3A%20%C3%A9%20a%20menor%20dignidade,denote%20nada%20de%20t%C3%A3o%20especial). Aliás, as antigas regras diziam que um planeta em sua própria face **deixa de ser peregrino**, isto é, adquire ao menos algum vínculo dignificante com o lugar onde está[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Face%3A%20%C3%A9%20a%20menor%20dignidade,denote%20nada%20de%20t%C3%A3o%20especial). Entretanto, é realmente uma vantagem mínima: um planeta apenas com face e sem outras dignidades permanece bastante fraco, apenas ligeiramente melhor do que nada.

Vale ressaltar o significado hermético dos decanatos: na astrologia hermética e magia renascentista, cada decanato possuía imagens simbólicas e _gênios_ associados, usados em talismãs e operações mágicas[pt.wikipedia.org](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetismo#:~:text=divino%20na%20natureza%20humana,30). Portanto, embora tecnicamente a face seja a menor das dignidades, ela carrega um peso oculto – ligando a astrologia à **demonologia astrológica** (os espíritos planetários/decanos) e à **Cabala**, onde às 36 faces às vezes se associam os 36 decanos da roda astrológica com influências espirituais específicas. Esse é um ponto em que a tradição hermética difere da abordagem puramente técnica: cada face é um “semblante” planetário, uma janela para forças sutis regidas por aquele planeta naquela fração do zodíaco.

### Peregrino: falta de dignidades essenciais

Após delinear todas as dignidades essenciais, podemos definir a condição de **peregrinidade**: um planeta é dito _peregrino_ quando, no signo onde está, não possui **nenhuma** dignidade essencial significativa (não é regente, nem exaltado, nem regente de triplicidade, nem tem seus termos ou face)astrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. O termo “peregrino” sugere um andarilho em terra estrangeira – o planeta está “solto”, sem poder ou apoio naquele território zodiacal. Planetas peregrinos são considerados vulneráveis e inconsistentes em seus efeitos, pois carecem de autoridade intrínseca no signo. É uma forma de debilidade essencial também, embora distinta de exílio e queda. Por exemplo, Saturno em Gêmeos é peregrino: não rege Gêmeos, não se exalta ali, Gêmeos é do elemento Ar (cujos regentes são Saturno e Mercúrio – aqui curiosamente Saturno é regente diurno de Ar, então Saturno em Gêmeos de dia teria triplicidade! – mau exemplo; vamos considerar Saturno em Áries: em Áries Saturno está em queda, mas isso já é debilidade forte; um exemplo melhor: Mercúrio em Sagitário – Mercúrio está em detrimento e queda em Sagitário e não tem termos nem face ali, logo extremamente peregrino e debilitado). De todo modo, a peregrinidade indica falta de propósito ou direcionamento claro para o planeta, dificultando a concretização dos assuntos que ele representaastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com.

A tradição medieval atribui _pontuação zero_ ao planeta peregrino, e reforça: “se não fosse alguma recepção mútua que o resgatasse, o peregrino nada pode fazer”astrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. De fato, uma **recepção mútua** – quando dois planetas ocupam mutuamente os domicílios (ou exaltações) um do outro – pode “trocar o status” entre eles e tirar ambos da peregrinidade, mesmo que individualmente não tenham dignidades no signo onde estãoastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Por exemplo, se Vênus está em Áries (exílio) e Marte em Touro (exílio), eles estão em recepção mútua de domicílio (Vênus rege Touro, Marte rege Áries). Isso atenua consideravelmente a debilidade de ambos, como se cada um emprestasse sua casa para o outro – uma espécie de cooperação cósmica. Assim, até planetas peregrinos ou debilitados podem melhorar de condição quando em forte recepção mútua, ou se forem **“sitiados” por benéficos** (isto é, estando entre Júpiter e Vênus, recebendo influência benéfica de ambos os lados)astrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Tais nuances mostram que as dignidades essenciais, embora fundamentais, não agem isoladamente – há sempre necessidade de avaliar o contexto completo do mapa.

Dignidades Acidentais: Condições de Fortalecimento ou Debilitação Circunstancial
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Passamos agora às **dignidades acidentais**, que são fatores que elevam ou reduzem a força de um planeta devido às circunstâncias específicas do mapa, e não por sua posição zodiacal em si[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=por%20ele%20ocupada,os%20%C3%A2ngulos%20da%20carta%20etc). Enquanto as dignidades essenciais são como o “status natal” do planeta (um Marte sendo um guerreiro forte em Áries ou um rei exaltado em Capricórnio, por exemplo), as acidentais representam sua **situação atual** no campo de batalha: se ele está numa posição vantajosa, com apoio, em movimento direto, etc. ou se está enfraquecido por condições adversas momentâneas. Listaremos os principais fatores acidentais a considerar, acompanhados de explicações:

*   **Posição por Casa Astrológica:** Planetas posicionados em casas **angulares** (1ª, 4ª, 7ª, 10ª casas) têm maior força acidental, pois essas casas representativas (especialmente 1 e 10) trazem visibilidade e poder de ação direta no mapaastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Um planeta angular “rege a cena”, manifestando seus efeitos de forma mais proeminente. Planetas em casas **sucedentes** (2ª, 5ª, 8ª, 11ª) têm força mediana, ainda capazes de atuar mas com menos ímpeto. Já os planetas em casas **cadentes** (3ª, 6ª, 9ª, 12ª) estão debilitados acidentalmente – sua influência tende a se dispersar ou demorar a se concretizarastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Por exemplo, Mercúrio na casa 3 (cadente) tem dificuldade em se expressar plenamente, exceto que a própria Lua alegra-se na 3 (júbilo da Lua) e mitiga essa regraastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Aliás, há **exceções notáveis** conhecidas como **júbilos**: certos planetas têm casas onde se sentem particularmente “felizes” mesmo sendo cadentes. São os _júbilos planetários_ da astrologia clássica: Lua na 3, Mercúrio na 1, Vênus na 5, Marte na 6, Júpiter na 11 e Saturno na 12 (o Sol é tradicionalmente citado na 9)astrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.comastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Nesses locais, cada planeta opera com inesperada facilidade – por exemplo, Saturno na 12ª (seu júbilo) consegue estruturar e contemplar no isolamento; Marte na 6ª consegue lutar contra doenças ou servidão de modo produtivo, etc. Em resumo, ser angular é uma dignidade acidental forte; ser cadente é uma debilidade acidental, a menos que compensada por júbilo ou outros fatoresastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com.
    
*   **Velocidade e Movimento Retrógrado:** A velocidade aparente do planeta indica sua vitalidade acidental. Um planeta em movimento **direto e rápido** (mais veloz que sua média diária) é considerado mais eficaz – é como um carro que anda bem, sem enguiços. Já um planeta **retrógrado** (movendo-se “para trás” no zodíaco, do ponto de vista geocêntrico) ou anormalmente **lento** encontra-se debilitado acidentalmenteastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. A retrogradação simboliza retorno, atraso e interiorização; frequentemente “retarda a expressão” do planeta e dificulta resultados imediatosastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Quando muitos planetas estão retrógrados num mapa (especialmente vários pessoais), indica-se uma vida inicial com obstáculos e um desenvolvimento mais tardio das promessas do mapaastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Em casos extremos, a pessoa pode sentir-se **“exilada” ou desconectada** do meio, agindo de modo muito próprio e independente do ritmo coletivoastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Por outro lado, se todos os planetas relevantes estão diretos, a vida tende a fluir com menos revisões e reviravoltas. Um detalhe importante: quando um planeta está mudando de direção – isto é, **estacionário** direto ou estacionário retrógrado – ele é considerado fraco, pois sua movimentação praticamente cessa naquele momento, simbolizando estagnação temporária.
    
*   **Combustão e Proximidade do Sol:** A relação angular com o Sol é crucial na avaliação da força acidental. Um planeta está **combusto** quando fica muito próximo ao Sol (tradicionalmente dentro de cerca de 8°30′ de arco)astrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Diz-se que “o Sol queima as funções do planeta” – sua luz ofuscante cega o planeta, que perde visibilidade e poderastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. A combustão é uma debilidade acidental severa; planetas combustos operam ocultamente, com dificuldades ou em crise, exceto no caso especial a seguir. Se a conjunção é **extremamente próxima** (até ~17 minutos de arco do centro do Sol), o planeta está em _Cazimi_ (no “coração” do Sol) – e paradoxalmente isso é considerado uma **forte dignidade acidental**. Nessa condição raríssima, o planeta é como um ministro reunido ao rei, recebendo honra e proteção do Sol. Portanto, um planeta _cazimi_ fica potencializado e purificado, enquanto um planeta meramente combusto (um pouco mais afastado, porém ainda sob os raios) está debilitado. Por exemplo, Mercúrio passa por fases frequentes de combustão; quando ele está exatamente no centro do disco solar (cazimi), seus significados podem se manifestar de maneira brilhante e genial, mas quando está 2° longe do Sol, ainda invisível, tende a indicar problemas de comunicação ou julgamento obscurecido. Outra faixa às vezes considerada é “sob os raios” – cerca de 17° até 8° do Sol – onde o planeta está enfraquecido, mas menos do que na combustão exata. Em suma: **Cazimi** (±0°17′) é um bônus acidental; **Combusto** (~0°18′–8°) é malefício acidental; **Sob os Raios** (~8°–17°) é uma leve debilidade.
    
*   **Aspectos com Outros Planetas:** Os aspectos que um planeta recebe ou aplica moldam significativamente sua dignidade acidental. Aspectos **harmônicos com benéficos** fortalecem o planeta; aspectos **difíceis com maléficos** tendem a prejudicá-lo (a menos que haja _recepção_, isto é, o maléfico esteja em signo governado pelo planeta afetado ou vice-versa, o que ameniza a tensão)astrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Por exemplo, a Lua em bom aspecto (trígono ou sextil) com Júpiter ou Vênus estará protegida e facilitada – suas funções emocionais e institivas fluem construtivamente. Já a Lua em quadratura ou oposição a Saturno ou Marte se vê afligida, indicando obstáculos, medos ou agressões, exceto se Saturno/Marte estiverem em signos da Lua ou em mútua recepção, o que traria alguma cooperação inesperadaastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Existe a condição de planeta **“sitiado” por maléficos**: quando um planeta se encontra entre Saturno e Marte, recebendo um e aplicando ao outro, sem interferência benéfica – essa configuração é altamente debilitante, pois o planeta fica cercado de influência hostil por todos os ladosastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.comastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Inversamente, um planeta **“escoltado” por benéficos** (por exemplo, tendo Vênus em um lado e Júpiter em outro de sua posição, ou separando-se de Vênus e aplicando a Júpiter) é engrandecido por essa companhia, ganhando suporte e proteção acidentaisastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Também vale observar se o planeta está em **aspecto com planetas debilitados**: conectar-se (por conjunção ou aspecto) a um planeta que esteja em detrimento ou queda pode transmitir parte dessa debilidade. A tradição medieval listava: qualquer planeta que aspecte, por exemplo, o Sol em Libra (queda) ou Aquário (detrimento), a Lua em Escorpião (queda) ou Capricórnio (detrimento), Mercúrio em Peixes ou Sagitário (seus detrimentos/queda), Vênus em Áries, Virgem ou Escorpião (detr/queda), Marte em Touro, Câncer ou Libra, Júpiter em Gêmeos, Virgem ou Capricórnio, Saturno em Áries, Câncer ou Leão – todos esses sairão prejudicados pelo contato com um astro fragilizadoastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. É como se “quem com feridos anda, ferido fica”: a luz transmitida pelo aspecto carrega a qualidade problemática. Igualmente, aspectar um planeta na 12ª casa (tradicional casa de provações) pode introverter a função daquele planetaastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com.
    
*   **Conjunção aos Nodos Lunares:** Os Nodos da Lua (Cabeça e Cauda do Dragão, ou Nodo Norte e Sul) são pontos matemáticos, mas na astrologia tradicional são considerados fatores de influência. Um planeta conjunto ao **Nodo Norte (Cabeça do Dragão)** é acidentalmente amplificado – o Nodo Norte tende a aumentar e expandir tudo o que toca (podendo levar a excessos)astrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Já um planeta conjunto ao **Nodo Sul (Cauda do Dragão)** é diminuído e drenado de força, já que o Nodo Sul simboliza redução, liberação e dispersãoastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Por exemplo, Marte conjunto ao Nodo Norte pode se tornar exageradamente marcial (por vezes violento em excesso), enquanto Marte conjunto ao Nodo Sul pode perder sua coragem ou iniciativa normal. Essas associações com os nodos derivam tanto da tradição ocidental quanto da védica; astrólogos herméticos frequentemente as consideram, embora com cautela, dada a natureza um tanto etérea dos nodos.
    
*   **Estado de “Feridade” (Feral):** Um planeta _feral_ é aquele que não forma __nenhum aspecto Ptolomaico_ (conjunção, sextil, quadratura, trígono ou oposição)_ com outro planeta no mapaastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Em outras palavras, ele está **isolado** no céu, agindo por conta própria sem se conectar a nenhuma outra energia planetária. Isso é considerado uma condição acidentalmente debilitante, pois o planeta fica unilateral – “age numa só direção, por um só objetivo e não conta com apoio”astrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Planetas ferais podem se comportar de maneira um tanto selvagem ou desconexa em relação ao contexto do mapa. Por exemplo, se apenas Vênus não aspecta nenhum outro planeta num mapa natal, aquela Vênus funciona sozinha – a pessoa pode ter valores, gostos ou relacionamentos que não dialogam com o restante de sua vida representada no mapa, exigindo esforço especial para integrar. Em termos práticos, a feridade indica falta de integração e é semelhante a estar peregrino e desacompanhado.
    

Em síntese, as dignidades acidentais avaliam **condições temporais ou situacionais** do planeta. Um mesmo Saturno em Capricórnio (dignificado essencialmente) pode estar muito forte ou não dependendo das condições acidentais: se estiver retrógrado, combusto no poente e na casa 8, por exemplo, boa parte de seu potencial ficará comprometido apesar do domicílio essencial. Por outro lado, um planeta essencialmente fraco pode ganhar destaque se estiver angular, direto e recebendo um trígono de Júpiter. Os astrólogos herméticos consideram ambas as camadas – essencial e acidental – para julgar o verdadeiro vigor de um astro no mapa. **William Lilly**, expoente do renascimento hermético-astrológico, chegou a criar uma tabela de pontuação combinada: cada dignidade essencial soma pontos e cada condição acidental soma (ou subtrai) pontos, permitindo quantificar a força relativa dos planetasastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=detrimento,uma%20dignidade%20maior). Embora nem todos utilizem a pontuação estritamente, o princípio permanece: é preciso verificar quantas dignidades vs. debilidades um planeta possui para determinar se ele agirá como um “benéfico” ou “maléfico” na práticaastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com.

Origens Herméticas das Dignidades: Influências Filosóficas e Esotéricas
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A sistematização das dignidades planetárias ocorreu na antiguidade greco-romana, especialmente com astrólogos como **Ptolomeu** (século II d.C.), que herdaram saberes da Mesopotâmia e Egito e os organizaram em estruturas racionais[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Ptolomeu%2C%20astr%C3%B3logo%2C%20astr%C3%B4nomo%20e%20ge%C3%B3grafo,pouco%20estudadas%20pelos%20astr%C3%B3logos%20modernos). No entanto, por trás dessa estrutura técnica reside uma **visão de mundo hermética** e mística, que conectou a astrologia com a filosofia espiritual, a Cabala e a Alquimia durante o período helenístico e, mais tarde, no Renascimento. Vamos explorar essas raízes:

*   **Corpus Hermeticum e a Visão Cosmológica:** Nos tratados herméticos atribuídos a Hermes Trismegisto (como o _Poimandres_), o universo é descrito como uma série de esferas emanadas do divino, povoadas por inteligências planetárias. A alma humana, segundo o mito hermético, desce através das sete esferas planetárias e em cada uma adquire certas qualidades (ou _vícios_) antes de encarnar no mundo sublunar[mortesubita.net](https://mortesubita.net/magia-cerimonial/as-sete-virtudes-hermeticas/#:~:text=a%20permiss%C3%A3o%20do%20Pai%2C%20a,assim%20adquire%20sua%20natureza%20corp%C3%B3rea). Por exemplo, ao passar pela esfera de Saturno, a alma receberia as tendências à melancolia e contemplação; em Júpiter, a aspiração à justiça; em Marte, a combatividade; e assim por diante – até chegar à Lua, onde ganha a imaginação e a sensibilidade[mortesubita.net](https://mortesubita.net/magia-cerimonial/as-sete-virtudes-hermeticas/#:~:text=a%20permiss%C3%A3o%20do%20Pai%2C%20a,assim%20adquire%20sua%20natureza%20corp%C3%B3rea). Essa narrativa fundamenta a ideia de que os planetas “revestem” a alma humana com características, o que se alinha perfeitamente com o conceito astrológico de dignidades: cada planeta tem lugares (signos) onde suas qualidades são puras e potentes (domicílios/exaltações) e lugares onde essas qualidades se pervertem ou enfraquecem (exílios/quedas). A **astrologia hermética** ensina, de forma geral, que o ser humano é um reflexo do céu – portando dentro de si as influências zodiacais, planetárias e até decanais (decanos), e que a vida é impactada por esses vínculos cósmicos[pt.wikipedia.org](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetismo#:~:text=divino%20na%20natureza%20humana,30). Daí surge naturalmente a importância de conhecer _onde_ um planeta está forte ou fraco, pois isso indica quais forças divinas operam com fluidez ou desarmonia na constituição daquela alma. O princípio hermético “assim em cima, como embaixo” garante que as dignidades planetárias não sejam arbitrárias: elas representam uma harmonia objetiva, uma espécie de _geometria sagrada_ das correspondências entre os deuses planetários e o Zodíaco.
    
*   **Astrólogos Neoplatônicos:** Filósofos neoplatônicos e teúrgos dos primeiros séculos (como Porfírio, Jâmblico, Proclo) incorporaram a astrologia em suas doutrinas. Em Alexandria, **astrônomos, neoplatônicos e hermetistas** foram responsáveis por desenvolver novas técnicas astrológicas – por exemplo, a introdução das **casas astrológicas** e dos **aspectos** geométricos, que não existiam na astrologia babilônica original[ozigurate.com.br](https://ozigurate.com.br/2021/04/12/sete-corpos-do-ser-humano/#:~:text=Em%20Alexandria%2C%20no%20Egito%20helenizado%2C,Romano%20at%C3%A9%20o%20subcontinente%20indiano). Isso evidencia que a própria ideia de dignidades acidentais (como a ênfase nas casas angulares ou em aspectos benéficos) nasceu desse caldo neoplatônico. Para os neoplatônicos, os planetas eram intermediários entre o Uno divino e o mundo material – potências animadoras que, conforme sua condição no céu, emanavam influências mais ordenadoras ou caóticas. Eles viam a ordem das dignidades essenciais como reflexo da **hierarquia cósmica**: o Sol e a Lua reinando em Leão e Câncer (centros da vitalidade), Saturno exaltado em Libra (equilíbrio cósmico da justiça), etc. Cada correspondência tinha uma razão simbólica. Plotino, embora crítico de uma astrologia determinista, reconhecia a _simpatia universal_ entre astros e coisas terrenas. Já Jâmblico propunha que, conhecendo as “afinidades” (dignidades), o mago poderia interagir com os deuses planetários de forma mais eficaz em rituais teúrgicos. Assim, as dignidades planetárias também informavam a **teurgia** – por exemplo, um talismã de Vênus seria confeccionado preferencialmente quando Vênus estivesse dignificada (em Touro, Libra ou Peixes) e angular, para garantir que a deusa estivesse “feliz” e presente em sua força máxima.
    
*   **Cabala Hermética e a Árvore da Vida:** No Renascimento, pensadores como **Marsilio Ficino** e **Giovanni Pico della Mirandola** integraram a astrologia com a Cabala judaica e o hermetismo, formando um grande sincretismo esotérico[pt.wikipedia.org](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetismo#:~:text=ocultas%20,27). A **Cabala** oferece a imagem da **Árvore da Vida**, com dez esferas (_Sephiroth_) que representam atributos divinos e cósmicos. Os hermetistas renascentistas associaram os sete planetas clássicos a sete dessas esferas: geralmente Saturno a Biná, Júpiter a Chesed, Marte a Geburah, Sol a Tiferet, Vênus a Netzach, Mercúrio a Hod e Lua a Yesod. Cada sephirah-planeta governa certas virtudes e partes da Criação. Por exemplo, Chesed/Júpiter corresponde à benevolência e expansão; Geburah/Marte à força e severidade; Tiferet/Sol à harmonia e beleza. Nessa ótica, quando um planeta está dignificado (essencialmente forte), ele canaliza sua sephirah de origem de modo mais puro. **Leão**, regido pelo Sol, estaria ligado a Tiferet – então o Sol em Leão expressa a “beleza e harmonia” divinas de Tiferet de forma exaltada no mundo. Já Aquário (oposto a Leão) seria visto como ligado a uma polaridade menos favorável para a energia solar, correspondente talvez a Hod (no caso do Sol exilado em Aquário, a intelectuação excessiva da luz). Essas correlações eram mais sugestivas do que literais, mas serviam para integrar astrologia e cabala. Além disso, a Cabala aloca os doze signos do zodíaco às doze _letras simples_ do alfabeto hebraico, e os sete planetas às sete _letras duplas_, conforme o _Sefer Yetzirah_. Por exemplo, a letra “Bet” corresponde a Saturno, “Gimel” a Júpiter, etc., e cada signo também recebe uma letra. Isso cria um sistema em que as dignidades (planeta regendo signo) também podem ser lidas como letras combinando-se – uma espécie de código alquímico-linguístico dentro da criação. Os magos herméticos estudavam essas relações para entender o “alfabeto cósmico”. A influência cabalística reforçou a ideia de que as dignidades planetárias não eram apenas disposições astrais, mas sim a manifestação de arquétipos divinos no cosmos. O próprio termo “dignidade” ganha um peso espiritual: remete à _dignidade divina_ expressa por aquele planeta quando em determinada porção celeste.
    
*   **Alquimia e Correspondências Metálicas:** A **Alquimia**, considerada pelos hermetistas como “astrologia da matéria”, também utiliza as correspondências planetárias. Os alquimistas clássicos ensinavam que os sete metais principais da antiguidade estão regidos pelos sete planetas[pt.wikipedia.org](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrologia_e_alquimia#:~:text=,Saturno%20%2C%20%2076). Assim, _Ouro_ é o metal do Sol, _Prata_ o da Lua, _Mercúrio_ (azougue) corresponde ao planeta Mercúrio, _Cobre_ a Vênus, _Ferro_ a Marte, _Estanho_ a Júpiter e _Chumbo_ a Saturno[pt.wikipedia.org](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrologia_e_alquimia#:~:text=,Saturno%20%2C%20%2076). Essa ligação fazia parte da visão unificada hermética: o que acontece nos céus reflete-se nos reinos mineral, vegetal e animal. Quando um planeta está essencialmente dignificado, dizia-se em analogia que seu metal está “puro” ou “curado” de imperfeições. Por exemplo, Saturno forte (domiciliado ou exaltado) equivaleria ao chumbo em estado perfeito – pronto para ser transmutado. Não por acaso, o termo “exaltação” também é empregado em alquimia para designar purificação ou elevação de uma substância a um estado mais nobre. Alquimistas renascentistas, como **Paracelso**, usavam a astrologia para determinar o momento propício de operar com determinado metal ou planta regida por um planeta – garantindo que esse planeta estivesse **bem dignificado no céu** naquele momento, potencializando assim o efeito da matéria. Por exemplo, colher uma erva de Júpiter numa hora de Júpiter, com Júpiter em Sagitário angular e crescente, era assegurar que a “virtude jovial” estivesse saturada na planta medicinal. As dignidades essenciais orientavam essas escolhas de timing mágico e médico. Um Marte **caído** em Câncer no céu, por exemplo, seria evitado para procedimentos cirúrgicos (que Marte rege) ou para iniciar a calcinação do ferro – pois sua influência estaria fraca ou desarmoniosa. Já um Marte **exaltado** em Capricórnio seria ideal para tais fins. Essa integração levou ao desenvolvimento do que se chamou **astrologia alquímica** ou espagírica, focada em curas e preparações alquímicas de acordo com a dignidade planetária[alquimiaoperativa.com](https://alquimiaoperativa.com/astrologia-alquimica-reflexao/#:~:text=,estanho%2C%20J%C3%BApiter%20e%2C%20para).
    
*   **Magia Cerimonial e Círculos Mágicos:** Os magos herméticos da era medieval e renascentista – e depois, nas ordens ocultistas modernas (Golden Dawn, etc.) – empregavam amplamente as dignidades em seus rituais. Um **círculo mágico hermético** geralmente vem adornado com símbolos planetários, signos do zodíaco, nomes de anjos e sefirot cabalísticas, tudo disposto de forma geométrica para representar o cosmos. O praticante se coloca no centro (microcosmo) evocando a ordem do macrocosmo ao redor. Nesses círculos, é comum ver a representação dos planetas nas direções associadas aos dias da semana (p.ex., Saturno a Oeste para Sábado, Sol a Leste para Domingo, etc.), ou em heptagramas que quando percorridos sequencialmente dão a ordem dos dias. As **dignidades planetárias** informam tais arranjos: por exemplo, sabe-se que cada planeta “rege” determinado signo e exalta-se em outro – esses signos costumam aparecer nos sigilos planetários e nos desenhos talismânicos. Um talismã de Vênus pode incluir Libra e Peixes (signos de domicílio e exaltação de Vênus) para invocar a dignidade plena de Vênus. Da mesma forma, evitar-se-ia colocar símbolos do signo de exílio ou queda para não “ofender” ou enfraquecer a influência invocada. Os magos também cronometravam seus ritos eletivos pela dignidade: um ritual de prosperidade seria marcado para um momento em que Júpiter estivesse forte (em Sagitário ou exaltado em Câncer, por exemplo, e de preferência angular), enquanto um ritual banimento de negatividade poderia ser feito com Saturno dignificado (pois Saturno forte afugenta medos e demônios) ou Marte forte para quebrar obstáculos.
    

_Diagrama esotérico hermético combinando correspondências planetárias, zodiacais e cabalísticas em um **círculo mágico**. Na circunferência externa, vemos os símbolos dos sete planetas dispostos em um **heptagrama** (estrela de sete pontas); ao seguir a sequência conectada pelos traços da estrela, obtém-se a ordem dos planetas associada aos dias da semana (Saturno → Júpiter → Marte → Sol → Vênus → Mercúrio → Lua, repetindo), ilustrando o ciclo semanal e a chamada “Ordem Caldaica” dos astros. Nos braços do heptagrama e ao redor, encontram-se também **nomes angelicais em hebraico** correspondentes a cada planeta, usados para invocação e proteção. Mais internamente, o diagrama apresenta representações da **Árvore da Vida** cabalística: é possível discernir as esferas (Sephiroth) e caminhos, indicando a associação de cada planeta a uma esfera cabalística (por exemplo, Biná–Saturno, Chesed–Júpiter, Geburah–Marte, Tiferet–Sol, Netzach–Vênus, Hod–Mercúrio, Yesod–Lua). Esses elementos cabalísticos aparecem integrados com símbolos dos quatro elementos e nomes divinos nos quadrantes, compondo um verdadeiro mandala de correspondências. Diagramas como este eram empregados em magia cerimonial hermética para criar um espaço sagrado onde “o Alto e o Baixo” se refletem – o magista ficava no centro (microcosmo) rodeado pelas potências planetárias e divinas (macrocosmo), harmonizadas pelas suas dignidades e relações corretas. Isso demonstra de forma visual a filosofia hermética de correspondências e a união entre astrologia, **Cabala** e **Magia/Alquimia**: cada planeta ocupa seu lugar de dignidade no círculo, cada anjo guardando sua esfera, formando uma rede ordenada de influências benéficas para o ritual[pt.wikipedia.org](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetismo#:~:text=1,vida%20como%20%20120%20pessoal)[pt.wikipedia.org](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetismo#:~:text=ocultas%20,27)._

Em resumo, o arcabouço das dignidades planetárias, embora tenha uma apresentação altamente técnica na literatura astrológica, está imbuído de significado cosmológico na tradição hermética. A ordem do cosmos – dos planetas regendo signos, exaltando-se aqui e caindo ali – reflete princípios metafísicos: harmonia e simpatia universal, correspondências entre níveis do ser e entre disciplinas (astrologia, cabala, alquimia). Os hermetistas viam a astrologia como uma linguagem simbólica que codifica a estrutura do universo. Dignificar um planeta é, em termos herméticos, conectá-lo ao seu _logos_ puro, à sua ideia divina; deixá-lo debilitado é sinal de desconexão ou desequilíbrio transitório nessa grande cadeia do ser.

Aplicações Práticas das Dignidades em Mapas Natais e Eleições Astrológicas
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conhecer e avaliar as dignidades planetárias é fundamental tanto na interpretação de **mapas natais** (horóscopos de nascimento) quanto na elaboração de **mapas eletivos** (escolha de momentos auspiciosos para eventos). Vejamos como esses conceitos são aplicados na prática astrológica:

**1\. Mapas Natais (Astrologia Genetlíaca):** No horóscopo natal, as dignidades essenciais indicam pontos fortes e fracos da personalidade e do destino do nativo, enquanto as dignidades acidentais mostram circunstâncias de manifestação desses potenciais. Por exemplo:

*   Um planeta que seja regente de um setor importante da vida (digamos, o regente do Ascendente que representa a saúde e identidade, ou o regente do Meio-Céu que representa a carreira) terá muito mais facilidade em entregar resultados positivos se estiver dignificado. **Caso 1:** Marte rege o Ascendente (Asc em Escorpião) e Marte está **domiciliado** na 1ª casa em Escorpião: isso sugere um indivíduo com iniciativa, energia e poder pessoais destacados, “dono de si”, com saúde e vitalidade reforçadasastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Esse Marte forte atuará como protetor nato do nativo. **Caso 2:** Marte rege o Asc em Escorpião, mas Marte está na 7ª casa em Touro (seu exílio): o indivíduo pode depender mais dos outros para se motivar, ter dificuldade em afirmar-se sozinho e possivelmente enfrentar conflitos relacionais para expressar sua vontadeastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. O assunto representado por Marte (no caso, a autoafirmação e vitalidade) flui com muito mais dificuldade. **Caso 3:** Marte rege Asc e está em Câncer na 4ª (sua queda): o nativo pode direcionar muita energia para assuntos familiares ou domésticos (4ª casa), mas de modo desajeitado ou emocionalmente tenso, podendo haver brigas em casa e tendência a reações defensivas (Marte em queda atua sem seu discernimento usual)astrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Esses exemplos ilustram como dignidades alteram drasticamente a leitura do mapa natal. Em geral, **planetas angulares e dignificados essenciais** são marcadores de talentos, facilidades ou proteções na vida. Por outro lado, **planetas regentes de áreas chave que estão debilitados** sinalizam áreas da vida com desafios, onde a pessoa precisará se esforçar mais ou lidar com faltas e atrasosastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com.
    

Os astrólogos tradicionais costumam computar uma espécie de “planeta mais digno” no mapa – chamado às vezes de **Almuten**. O almuten de determinado ponto (por exemplo, do Ascendente ou do Mapa como um todo) é aquele planeta que soma mais pontos de dignidade naquele contextoastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Esse planeta, por sua força, acaba assumindo um papel de protagonismo. Por exemplo, se num mapa Saturno tem 5 pontos de domicílio + 4 de exaltação + está angular, etc., e é almuten do Mapa, ele pode indicar que o indivíduo terá um forte componente saturnino positivo (responsabilidade, estrutura, sabedoria ao longo da vida), mesmo que Saturno tradicionalmente seja considerado “maléfico”. Esse ponto ressalta que _dignidade torna um planeta mais benéfico, e debilidade torna-o mais maléfico_, independentemente de sua natureza intrínsecaastrologiaeradeaquario.blogspot.com. Por exemplo, **Júpiter debilitado** (digamos, Júpiter em Capricórnio, retrógrado e cadente) pode funcionar quase como um maleficuzinho – trazendo desperdícios, exageros frustrados ou promessas vazias. Já **Saturno dignificado** (em Libra, angular e bem aspectado) torna-se muito construtivo e protetor – um “velho sábio” em vez de um vilão. Assim, na leitura natal, avaliar as dignidades e debilidades permite **qualificar** os planetas: um planeta “bom” em mapa natal não é simplesmente Vênus ou Júpiter por serem naturais benéficos, mas sim aquele que está forte e livre de aflições; e um planeta “problemático” será aquele enfraquecido ou aflito, mesmo que seja Vênus. Essa abordagem técnica ajuda a evitar simplificações e a fornecer aconselhamentos mais precisos.

Além disso, a condição acidental indica _quando_ e _como_ os potenciais se manifestam. Um planeta dignificado mas muito lento ou retrógrado pode indicar que os frutos daquele talento vêm tardiamente (p.ex., um Saturno forte porém retrógrado pode mostrar sucesso profissional após muitos anos de perseverança, com maturidade). Um planeta peregrino e aflito na juventude pode ganhar força por progressões ou direções em determinada idade se entrar em dignidade, etc. A hermenêutica hermética integrava inclusive a ideia de **transmutação pessoal**: as debilidades seriam desafios cármicos a serem superados – “metais vis” a serem transformados no ouro espiritual. O mapa natal então serve como mapa alquímico: as dignidades mostram os pontos de apoio e as debilidades mostram onde aplicar o trabalho interior.

**2\. Astrologia Eletiva:** Ao eleger um momento para uma atividade (seja casamento, abertura de empresa, cirurgia, consagração de talismã, etc.), a consideração das dignidades planetárias é crucial. Em astrologia eletiva, desejamos colocar os planetas regentes do assunto o mais forte e bem colocados possível, para garantir um resultado favorável. Exemplos de princípios eletivos:

*   **Escolha de Domicílios e Exaltações:** Se vamos eleger um momento para um ato venusiano (um casamento, por exemplo, regido por Vênus), buscamos Vênus em um signo de **dignidade essencial** – idealmente em Touro ou Libra (domicílios) ou em Peixes (exaltação). Isso garante que Vênus “esteja à vontade” no céu, prometendo harmonia, amor e cooperação ao evento[constelar.com.br](https://constelar.com.br/tecnica-astrologica/tradicional/dignidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Regente%20%E2%80%93%20O%20regente%20%C3%A9,de%20maneira%20mais%20direta%20e)[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Exalta%C3%A7%C3%A3o%3A%C2%A0aqui%20o%20planeta%20n%C3%A3o%20est%C3%A1,se%20exaltada%20em%20qualquer). Evitamos, claro, casar com Vênus em Áries ou Escorpião (exílio) ou em Virgem (queda), pois nesses signos Vênus estaria fraca ou “descontente”, predispondo a tensões. De modo semelhante, para uma eleição de cirurgia (Marte e o signo que rege a parte do corpo envolvida são importantes), seria benéfico ter Marte forte e bem disposto – talvez em Capricórnio (exaltação) e não aflito – para que a intervenção seja eficaz e sem complicações. Esses cuidados são a aplicação direta das tabelas de dignidades: escolher momentos em que os planetas-chave estejam em signos onde manifestam suas virtudes positivamente.
    
*   **Condições Acidentais na Eleição:** Além do signo, assegura-se que o planeta esteja em boa casa e situação. Por exemplo, na maioria das eleições deseja-se evitar planetas retrógrados ou combustos. Se for inevitável (às vezes numa janela de tempo todos os planetas benéficos estão combustos pelo Sol, como ocorre anualmente com Mercúrio ou Vênus), o astrólogo eletivo pode ao menos escolher um **cazimi**, se oportuno, transformando a combustão em dignidade. Ou adiar a eleição para depois que o planeta saia dos raios solares. Igualmente, se Júpiter está dignificado em Sagitário mas temporariamente cadente na casa 12, ele perde muito de sua potência – então seria melhor aguardá-lo ingressar na casa 11 ou 10 pelo movimento da hora. Em suma, na carta eletiva ideal, colocamos: regente do Ascendente forte (representando o começo do empreendimento vigoroso), regente da casa do assunto forte (ex: regente da 7 em dignidade para casamentos), a Lua (cronometrista dos eventos) também forte, aumentando e aspectando planetas benéficos, etc. Ao mesmo tempo, tentamos colocar eventuais planetas “problemáticos” do tema em debilidade ou restrição – por exemplo, se tememos inimigos ou complicações (regidos pela casa 12 ou Marte/Saturno), às vezes convém que o planeta que os representa esteja **debilitado** e cadente, para que não tenha força de prejudicar.
    

Na prática renascentista, muito disso era sistematizado: livros de eletiva diziam por exemplo _“Faça a Lua aplicar ao regente da coisa desejada, ambos em dignidade”_. Se alguém quer sucesso profissional (assunto da casa 10, regente digamos é Mercúrio), far-se-ia a Lua (significadora do curso do evento) aplicar um aspecto harmônico a Mercúrio, com Mercúrio forte em Virgem na 10ª casa, e Lua talvez em Touro exaltada na 2ª (indicando ganhos) – uma receita de sucesso material. Outro detalhe: dignidades participam de _recepções_ importantes em eletivas. Uma **recepção mútua** intencional pode ser usada quando não dá para ter o planeta exatamente no seu domicílio. Por exemplo, se desejamos ajudar um contrato (Mercúrio) e uma parceria (Vênus), mas Mercúrio estará em Libra e Vênus em Gêmeos na data disponível – isso é uma recepção mútua (Mercúrio em domicílio de Vênus e Vênus em domicílio de Mercúrio), o que embora cada um esteja peregrino no próprio signo, juntos eles trocam dignidades e se fortalecem. Isso pode ser aproveitado como um “consolo” para não se ter tudo perfeito. Assim, a arte eletiva envolve equilibrar e compensar dignidades.

*   **Magia Astrológica:** Citada anteriormente, é um ramo prático onde as dignidades são absolutamente determinantes. Quando criando um **talisman planetário**, a regra de ouro é: o planeta deve estar o mais dignificado e bem posicionado possível, e livre de aflições, no momento da consagração. Por exemplo, um talismã do Sol: idealmente confeccionar durante o Sol em Leão ou Áries (domicílio ou exaltação), de dia, numa domingo, com Sol na 10ª casa e crescente, sem Saturno ou Marte o aspectando negativamente. Esse seria um “Sol celestial” capturado no objeto. Se, ao contrário, alguém fizesse um talismã solar com Sol em Libra (queda) e combusto (impossível pois Sol não pode estar combusto a si mesmo, mas digamos, Sol aflito por Marte) – estaria impregnando o objeto de uma energia solar desequilibrada ou fraca, o que poderia até ser contraproducente. Assim, a ética hermética recomendava: só se deve talismar algo quando as dignidades indicam concordância do cosmos – quase que uma permissão divina de que aquele trabalho prosperará. O mesmo vale para rituais e orações planetárias: orar para Júpiter (ou fazer _oratio_ a Sachiel, anjo de Júpiter) na hora em que Júpiter está forte e angular era considerado muito mais eficaz.
    

**3\. Astrologia Horária (Horary):** Ainda cabe mencionar que na técnica de astrologia horária – embora não tenha sido diretamente perguntada, é uma aplicação prática – as dignidades são ativamente utilizadas para julgamentos. Em horária (que responde perguntas com base em um mapa do momento da pergunta), verificar se o significador do quesito está em dignidade ou debilidade pode literalmente dar a resposta. Por exemplo, uma pergunta “Meu parceiro me ama?” – o regente da casa 7 representando o parceiro, se o encontramos em exaltação da Lua (que representa o querente) e conjunto a ela, diríamos que sim, ele te “exalta”. Se estivesse peregrino ou no exílio da Lua, a resposta tenderia ao negativo. William Lilly e outros deixaram tabelas e máximas: _“Se o significador do querente recebe por dignidade essencial o significador do quesito, então há mérito, amor ou valor verdadeiro”_, etc. Ou _“Se os significadores se aplicam mas sem dignidade, o resultado ocorre mas sem proveito”_. Assim, as dignidades funcionam como uma linguagem de _“quem gosta de quem e com que intensidade”_ dentro do mapa horário. Essa talvez seja a aplicação mais nitidamente ligada à ideia original de dignidade como afinidade e **compreensão** entre planetas e signos[astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com](https://astrologiadadepressao.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/dignidades-e-debilidades-planetarias/#:~:text=Exalta%C3%A7%C3%A3o%3A%C2%A0aqui%20o%20planeta%20n%C3%A3o%20est%C3%A1,se%20exaltada%20em%20qualquer) – pois na horária se uma pessoa (planeta) está no signo governado por outro, diz-se que “ela está sob o poder/território do outro, portanto se importa com ele”.

Em conclusão, as dignidades planetárias segundo a astrologia hermética formam um sistema completo que permeia tanto a teoria quanto a prática astrológica. Desde a leitura do caráter de um nativo até a seleção de um momento propício para a fundação de uma cidade ou a consagração de um talismã, os astrólogos herméticos aplicam esses princípios para **garantir harmonia com a ordem cósmica**. Este relatório técnico apresentou definições detalhadas das dignidades essenciais (domicílio, exaltação, triplicidade, termos e faces) e de seus opostos (exílio, queda, peregrinidade), acompanhado de tabelas tradicionais para referência; descreveu as dignidades acidentais principais (posição por casa, movimento, aspectos etc.) e suas implicações; traçou as raízes filosóficas e esotéricas dessas ideias na tradição hermética, na Cabala e na Alquimia; e demonstrou a utilidade prática de avaliar dignidades em diversos ramos da astrologia. Com isso, espera-se fornecer ao leitor uma compreensão clara e precisa do tema, combinando a linguagem técnica acessível com a profundidade simbólica que ele carrega. Afinal, como diziam os hermetistas: _“Conhece a ordem celeste, e conhecerás a ti mesmo e os deuses”_ – e as dignidades planetárias são uma parte essencial dessa ordem celeste tal como entendida desde Hermes Trismegisto até os astrólogos contemporâneos que resgatam a sabedoria tradicional.
