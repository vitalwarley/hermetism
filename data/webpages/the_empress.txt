[00:07] [Music]
[00:10] greetings and welcome to this video on
[00:12] the Empress as you can see from the
[00:16] labels that I've placed on the card
[00:21] itself there's an awful lot to get
[00:23] through in this particular major arcana
[00:27] trump and it's all cool stuff we've got
[00:30] a fair bit of alchemy going on which was
[00:34] introduced a little bit in the Magus but
[00:37] we have a lot more fundamentals being
[00:41] expressed in this card and alchemy is
[00:44] quite an important theme that runs
[00:47] through this particular deck so it's
[00:49] important to get to grips with this
[00:50] pretty early on other stuff include the
[00:56] influence of the moon and also her
[00:59] position on the Tree of Life is
[01:01] extremely important but it starts off
[01:05] really with mythology because she
[01:08] represents Venus or Aphrodite and she
[01:15] was the goddess of love and sexuality so
[01:21] she was also a bit mischievous because
[01:23] she had an affair with the Roman god of
[01:26] war which is Mars so he had this light
[01:30] and dark the love and war the blending
[01:33] of opposites here and as we can see she
[01:39] represents Venus he represents the
[01:42] Emperor represents Mars and she's the
[01:44] consort of the Emperor the fact that she
[01:49] does have a mischievous side is also
[01:52] reflected in Crowley's summary of her in
[01:58] his book the book of Thoth he says in
[02:00] this card she's shown in her most
[02:02] general manifest
[02:04] and she combines the highest spiritual
[02:07] with the lowest material qualities and
[02:14] because of its aamna form presentation
[02:17] the student who is dazzled by any given
[02:20] manifestation of the Empress may be led
[02:24] astray and he finishes this particular
[02:27] section by saying in no other card is it
[02:31] so necessary to disregard the parts to
[02:35] concentrate upon the whole so obviously
[02:37] there the what she represents is very
[02:41] important spiritually but he's implying
[02:44] that there are distractions to her
[02:49] energy as well depending on where she's
[02:52] manifesting from a spiritual point of
[02:55] view have used this prism analogy before
[02:58] where we have the oneness the line of
[03:01] God been refracted through the prism and
[03:06] manifesting in the various different
[03:09] colors and uniqueness of creation and
[03:12] the Empress sits in the doorway between
[03:14] the two so she is the doorway to the
[03:18] soul going back to God in its spiritual
[03:21] journey
[03:22] or looking at the finite nature of life
[03:27] itself and each incarnation is you know
[03:31] the migration of the soul wants the
[03:35] physical body dies through the various
[03:40] different spiritual realms and indeed
[03:42] back again if that soil is reincarnating
[03:47] so that's enough introduction I'll now
[03:51] go on to the divinatory meanings of the
[03:53] card and then we go on to the more
[03:56] detailed aspects of it for those that
[03:59] want to
[03:59] look at this card in some detail looking
[04:05] at some upright divinatory meanings for
[04:07] the Empress she can represent birth
[04:09] pregnancy fertility she is indeed often
[04:15] seen pregnant and her arm position here
[04:18] has relevance alchemically but also it's
[04:23] the position of holding a child baby you
[04:28] can also represent being in touch with
[04:29] the beauty of your life as Venus is all
[04:34] about beauty she can represent someone
[04:38] who needs nurturing exploring our
[04:42] relationship with our mother and she can
[04:46] also describe someone empathic and
[04:49] caring in their personality in touch
[04:54] with universal love and also reminding
[04:59] us that spirituality is expressed from
[05:01] the heart and not ahead
[05:05] spending time with nature we see in the
[05:11] bride wait card here she's very much
[05:13] surrounded by nature and nurturing
[05:19] others and those around you as well as
[05:22] yourself so these are some of the
[05:25] approach of Industry meanings that the
[05:27] Empress can represent in a reading and
[05:31] obviously no card is taken on its own so
[05:34] it would depend on the other cards in
[05:36] the reading as to what really would be
[05:39] relevant there if the Empress is
[05:43] reversed it could represent vanity and I
[05:45] did speak about some of the trappings of
[05:48] the Empress at the beginning in the
[05:51] introduction sexual or emotional
[05:54] manipulation unable to give or
[06:00] experience love being damaged
[06:02] emotionally perhaps this one here can
[06:05] also represent
[06:06] fatality unresolved conflicts with one's
[06:10] mother lack of self-love unwanted
[06:15] pregnancy so you can see how these two
[06:17] relate to the Empress really without
[06:19] going through a lot of the symbolism
[06:21] unable to come to connect with the
[06:24] universal love on your spiritual journey
[06:29] not enjoying your spiritual work at the
[06:31] moment and conflicts so the spiritual
[06:35] references are many to do with the
[06:37] information we'll get further in the
[06:39] video but just quickly look at the
[06:45] rider-waite version here and here is a
[06:52] quote from me pictorial guide to the
[06:54] Tarot by weight and he says she's the
[06:57] inferior Garden of Eden the earthly
[07:00] paradise all that is symbolized by the
[07:02] visible house of man I think she caught
[07:06] he calls her the inferior Garden of Eden
[07:09] posit possibly because she is just the
[07:12] physical manifestation whereas the
[07:14] Garden of Eden really is not a physical
[07:17] thing so for those of people looking for
[07:22] the Garden of Eden on the earth
[07:23] physically I wish you all the best but
[07:27] does that in fact refer to a spiritual
[07:29] realms so she's that vehicle through
[07:34] which on that doorway between spirit and
[07:38] matter that I'll go through pretty much
[07:40] in the rest of the video this is a
[07:44] position of the Empress on the Tree of
[07:47] Life she is in fact on the path between
[07:50] bina and hokhmah Ben are being the
[07:54] receptive female and hokhmah being a
[07:59] masculine Sephiroth this particular path
[08:04] is called the path of illuminating
[08:07] intelligent
[08:08] so all of these paths here have a unique
[08:14] name so this this is the path of
[08:17] illuminating intelligence so what does
[08:19] that mean it means that that light of
[08:23] creation when we looked at the prism
[08:27] here is contained within every form of
[08:34] the universe
[08:36] it's that spiritual light it's the light
[08:40] personally that I meditate on with our
[08:42] meditation group that I advertised on my
[08:47] website so it's that spiritual line
[08:50] which illuminates form and gives it
[08:54] intelligence so we have been art the
[08:58] universal female principle here which
[09:01] receives the male force from hokhmah and
[09:05] she nurtures this force in her womb just
[09:10] as the Empress on the physical plane
[09:15] nurtures the infant or gives birth to
[09:19] the infant and in a universal setting
[09:26] from a universal and spiritual
[09:28] perspective she delivers this
[09:32] transformed energy as it travels down
[09:34] the path of the tree of life and this is
[09:38] what Crowley meant when he said that
[09:41] this is just a general figure which
[09:45] represents both the highest material and
[09:48] the lowest manifestations of love
[09:59] she's slightly less well placed on the
[10:02] tree of life because she's unlike the
[10:06] priestess she's not in direct contact
[10:11] with Curtis so she's slightly less well
[10:14] placed than the priestess however she
[10:19] does rule the very last path before the
[10:23] abyss which I haven't put in here I'll
[10:26] just place it in so these three are
[10:31] representing the Holy Trinity there are
[10:34] the purest of the sefirah on the Tree of
[10:37] Life
[10:38] and she represents the last path before
[10:40] the energy crosses down into the lower
[10:44] parts of the Tree of Life so that's what
[10:48] I was getting out when I referred to the
[10:51] Empress as being at the doorway between
[10:53] spirit and and matter
[10:57] again that's oversimplified but it gives
[11:00] you some idea of the role of the Empress
[11:06] being ruled by Venus we can transpose
[11:11] the glyph of Venus on the Tree of Life
[11:14] and as you can see it very nicely unites
[11:19] all of the Sephirah on the tree of life
[11:22] and this uniting principle is symbolic
[11:27] of her universal love so love at this
[11:32] level of the tree doesn't mean like
[11:34] projection and desire that can be
[11:36] experienced further down the tree or
[11:40] even manifesting in the world it's it's
[11:43] the universal love and intelligence that
[11:48] is within the spiritual light of
[11:51] creation as I said she does have a lower
[11:55] octave of expression when she manifests
[11:58] materially so we'll now move on to her
[12:03] astrological and Hebrew attributions so
[12:09] much of this I've gone through already
[12:10] the Hebrew association with the Empress
[12:13] is the Hebrew letter dalet or it's even
[12:20] being pronounced dole F so I don't know
[12:23] which one is correct but the meaning of
[12:26] this term is doors so this is the
[12:29] doorway and one thing I probably didn't
[12:33] show you is the doorways is here that I
[12:37] think is the white light of Quetta you
[12:39] got like an archway here at the top of
[12:41] the car of the card here so I have
[12:45] labeled this on the diagram so there she
[12:51] sits her Venus symbolism I've already
[12:57] gone through and that was really
[12:59] expressed in the divinity meanings so
[13:01] when we go on to the next section which
[13:03] is the symbolism this is a picture of
[13:08] Isis the goddess Isis which is another
[13:14] expression of the Empress we talked
[13:18] about the Empress representing Venus or
[13:22] Aphrodite's in her more spiritual realms
[13:27] she represents Isis and here we have the
[13:30] triple moon and if we look at the
[13:37] Empress we have this triple moon here
[13:40] and in the middle we have an orb with a
[13:48] cross and this is a particular cross
[13:51] which called a maltese cross
[13:57] now the Orban cross is symbolic of the
[14:04] catalyst in terms of alchemy and a
[14:09] catalyst is something that essentially
[14:11] speeds up a reaction and this is the
[14:16] chemical glyph of antimony and it'll
[14:22] speak a little bit more about that later
[14:25] on but as I said she has a Maltese cross
[14:29] there which is specific form of cross
[14:31] rather than just the basic cross of
[14:36] antimony so we're looking at the Maltese
[14:39] cross the Maltese cross represents the
[14:46] four elements here so what this is
[14:52] trying to get at in the figure is just
[14:55] the perfect balance of these elements
[14:59] that occurs when she is expressing her
[15:03] highest form it's almost like because
[15:08] she's coming from a highest spiritual
[15:11] perspective all of the elements are in
[15:16] balance
[15:21] and there's a certain neutrality of the
[15:24] elements because the white light of
[15:27] Quetta here doesn't really contain the
[15:33] elements themselves anymore it's really
[15:35] just the potential of and we noticed
[15:38] that cata on the tree of life is the
[15:42] Sephiroth of potential here at the top
[15:49] and I said that the moon was important
[15:52] she sits between as well as having the
[15:55] headdress here of waxing and waning
[15:58] moons she has on each side of her she
[16:06] sits between the waxing moon here which
[16:11] she faces so it's getting bigger as the
[16:17] Sun moves to the left here and the
[16:20] waning moon here
[16:27] so again some moving to the left and it
[16:30] will eventually be blotted out these two
[16:34] spiritually have different meanings with
[16:36] the waxing moon is more associated with
[16:39] growth fertility and love which is
[16:42] essentially what the card represents us
[16:44] why she faces down moon and the waning
[16:47] moon is more associated with letting go
[16:49] of things crowded also says that these
[16:57] moons are revolving we see they're sort
[17:01] of orbital things here with the waning
[17:04] orbit being more predominant so zooming
[17:09] out it's interesting to know that the
[17:12] two touch here right in the center of
[17:17] her torso Oh more or less solar plexus
[17:24] pareo and Crowley says that these
[17:29] revolving moons are symbolic of the
[17:32] balancing of opposites so again we have
[17:37] that balance that we saw in the Maltese
[17:41] Cross
[17:43] so yes ironic that these two orbits here
[17:47] actually cross in solar plexus where she
[17:50] actually gives birth so again it's that
[17:52] perfect balance that comes from the
[17:57] expression of her higher self next up we
[18:04] have other representations of her
[18:09] association with Venus and these are the
[18:13] Dove here and the sparrow so a quote
[18:21] online from this I've actually put above
[18:25] and it says in the vegetable kingdom the
[18:28] Myrtle rose apple and poppy among others
[18:31] was
[18:32] sacred to Aphrodite which is associated
[18:35] with Venus as in the animal world where
[18:38] the sparrow dove Swan and swallow so we
[18:42] have the sparrow and of here and we also
[18:47] have the rose down at the bottom here
[18:55] it's very less obvious in this card than
[19:00] it is in the Broadway card you can
[19:04] easily see that she's sitting on a
[19:06] throne here and you've got some water in
[19:11] the background here nourishing all of
[19:14] nature the same is actually happening in
[19:17] this card it's just not quite so visible
[19:22] these are twisted blue uprights off her
[19:29] throne where the sparrow and the Dove
[19:33] set so she's on a throne here but these
[19:38] are blue twisted uprights here so it's
[19:41] represents the fluidity of the feminine
[19:46] but it just make it harder to pick out
[19:52] her dress is rose and green also the
[19:56] colors of Venus and she does have bees
[20:01] on her dress here is even right in we
[20:07] can see those bees here and they
[20:10] represent her energy and vitality so we
[20:14] have things in like health shops like
[20:17] bee propolis which is to do with the
[20:22] immigration of the immune system again
[20:25] supposed to help with one's energy and
[20:27] vitality so we have bees on her
[20:31] ress here and more difficult to pick out
[20:34] we have this spiral pattern with the
[20:36] Domino in the center here the spiral
[20:41] pattern is like the spiral nature of the
[20:43] universe you get spiral galaxies and
[20:45] Domino the black and white is duality
[20:48] cylinder algae contained within
[20:50] universality and another symbolic
[20:54] representation of the fact that she
[20:56] represents the whole and combines the
[20:58] whole with love even at a zoomed up
[21:07] level we can't really see the pattern on
[21:09] her girdle here but it is supposed to
[21:11] contain the different glyphs of the
[21:14] zodiac and similar to the last point
[21:20] about a spiral galaxies and the duality
[21:22] the Zodiac pattern on it means that she
[21:26] unites all the different aspects of the
[21:27] Zodiac zodiac representing the 12 labors
[21:32] of Hercules
[21:33] so is this love that unites everything
[21:38] she also holds the Blue Lotus of Isis in
[21:43] her right hand held over the heart
[21:46] chakra another symbol of universal love
[21:51] expressed through the wellspring of the
[21:53] heart this is why said inner divinity
[21:56] meanings that a spiritual path is more
[21:58] of the heart or not of the head and the
[22:02] blue color is a symbol of water which is
[22:04] her element again representing fertility
[22:07] and creativity the Lotus itself has four
[22:13] petals as we can see showing
[22:19] representing the Sephiroth head which is
[22:26] indicating a manifestation of love from
[22:31] the divine in two
[22:33] matter so looking at the Tree of Life
[22:40] this is the next several on from below
[22:45] so it's that energy then crossing the
[22:47] abyss to be more involved in the
[22:50] physical universe even though her set
[22:53] wasn't strictly physical but it's the
[22:59] beginning of structure in the universe
[23:03] my set of arms were curved as if holding
[23:06] a baby so if we look at pictures of I'm
[23:09] Isis here she's holding the baby horse
[23:14] and in Sulli mia this is a ritual
[23:21] gesture of magic where we have Isis of
[23:24] rejoicing or later triumphant triumphant
[23:29] with the head looking downwards the
[23:32] right hand pinches the left nipple while
[23:36] the left hand cradles just below the
[23:39] solar plexus as if holding a baby so
[23:41] that is similar to the Empress here we
[23:47] now move on to the bottom section of the
[23:49] card and there's an awful lot going on
[23:51] here I'll just start by this white rose
[23:56] here that I mentioned which is a symbol
[23:58] of Venus the whiteness is also symbolic
[24:02] of the purity of the energy that the
[24:05] Empress expresses and you've got like a
[24:08] green river here again green with Venus
[24:15] now you do have if you count this one
[24:18] here which looks like a fish so you've
[24:19] got one two three four five six seven
[24:22] eight nine ten fish
[24:25] and this could well represent that
[24:29] manifestation in Mal coud on the tree of
[24:33] life so it's that universal energy going
[24:38] out into matter and being expressed now
[24:41] I've never seen that anywhere at all in
[24:46] terms of counting fish they're usually
[24:51] just these two here that are mentioned
[24:54] but all of these things are here for a
[24:56] reason so as I say I haven't seen that
[24:59] in any book it's just something that
[25:00] I've noticed doing at this video point
[25:03] now we have this figure here which is
[25:06] the fleur de lis French is little better
[25:13] than my Hebrew it's worth just going
[25:17] through this particular symbolism it
[25:23] really relates back to the 12th century
[25:24] when a French monarch used this symbol
[25:27] on his shield and English clings later
[25:30] used a symbol on their coats of arms to
[25:34] emphasize their claims to the throne of
[25:36] France we can break this word down and
[25:41] look at its components so Fleur is
[25:43] flower Lise hell why is it sometimes
[25:47] spelled is Lily now lily is also known
[25:51] as the may birth flower so in the
[25:54] language of flowers this may birth
[25:56] flower represents like the purity
[26:00] majesty and honor and the lily is
[26:05] composed of three petals which are
[26:11] secured around the base with three
[26:17] indicating if we go back to our tree of
[26:19] life here and these are our subpoena
[26:26] so I think looking at the history of the
[26:29] fleur-de-lis I think they're here
[26:31] because essentially we are looking at a
[26:38] lady on a throne and she's like a
[26:41] mourner but not in the conventional
[26:43] sense not in like a worldly sense like
[26:46] the Queen sitting on a throne with a
[26:48] crown of jewels which is basically just
[26:52] materialism she's actually got her
[26:55] spiritual crown and so I think that is
[26:58] just a representation of her strength of
[27:01] purpose and you know the the place that
[27:06] she holds on the tree of life so that
[27:12] completes the section on symbolism the
[27:14] rest of the symbolism that I'm going to
[27:16] talk about will be related to alchemy
[27:20] which is that was quite important part
[27:23] which is why I've left it until at the
[27:25] end
[27:27] Crowley relates the Empress here to the
[27:32] alchemical substance of salt we can see
[27:41] that this circular glyph of salt is
[27:45] similar to her position in terms of her
[27:51] arms here this circular nature sulfur is
[28:03] this glyph of a triangle surmounted on a
[28:06] cross and if we go back to the original
[28:10] picture of the Emperor you've got this
[28:12] triangular pose that he has with his
[28:18] legs so the Emperor is representing
[28:21] sulfur the Empress is salt and I said
[28:27] that the catalyst was this antimony here
[28:30] with the orb and the cross these are
[28:34] also linked in
[28:35] in Bogota 'the with the three gunas
[28:39] which is a hindu philosophy with the
[28:43] rogers here these are just modes of
[28:46] existence the gunas so with the rogers
[28:49] you've got creative its action its
[28:52] passion with salt you've got more in
[28:55] action and thus at verse here this
[28:59] represents purity and harmony and these
[29:03] are the three gunas and that ties in
[29:09] with a tree of life way you've got the
[29:10] force of hokhmah here going into been a
[29:13] sabina is just waiting for that force so
[29:18] she can actually start the process of
[29:21] creation of the universe from the womb
[29:25] of banana so the main features of the
[29:32] lower card are the shield here and the
[29:36] pelican these are the two things that
[29:38] stand out up of the detail so i've just
[29:45] drawn this diagram here where we've got
[29:47] this alchemical process going on now
[29:51] alchemy is obviously the turning of base
[29:53] metals into gold but ultimately from a
[29:57] spiritual viewpoint it's about turning
[30:00] the soul and purifying it into the so
[30:05] it's it transcends the creation to find
[30:08] the purity of God and this is
[30:11] represented alchemically here we've got
[30:14] the pelican which is representing the
[30:16] dross bit and the shield representing
[30:20] the pure bit so that's as we said our
[30:24] attachments to the world and so we think
[30:28] we are we move into a state of a
[30:31] spiritual purity and this also relates
[30:34] to the three eons which I mentioned in
[30:36] the previous video which is why I wanted
[30:38] to do the Eon video first because the
[30:40] pelican is unique in well traditionally
[30:45] it was thought in medieval times that it
[30:47] feeds its young
[30:48] with the blood from its own heart and
[30:51] therefore it's representing an eon an
[30:55] oldie on of where religion looked at
[31:00] sacrificial things in order to get to
[31:04] God such as the crucifixion of Christ
[31:07] which also which is representing a
[31:09] spiritual process you don't know what I
[31:12] don't know personally whether that
[31:14] happened physically or not but it is a
[31:17] spiritual process it's like an inner
[31:19] crucifixion of the five senses and I go
[31:21] through that a lot in the mystic Bible
[31:24] section on my website so this like an
[31:26] old Aeon here and the new Aeon is the
[31:32] purified white tincture and this is the
[31:35] Aeon of Horus of alchemy and it's about
[31:40] getting to grips with purifying the soul
[31:44] through spiritual practice rather than
[31:47] just based religion and a tradition an
[31:54] antimony is the catalyst that does that
[31:58] distinction between the Pelican and the
[32:00] shield so we can see really the antimony
[32:03] ultimately represents spiritual practice
[32:06] that is the catalyst and doesn't happen
[32:07] without spiritual practice whether it be
[32:09] meditation or whatever practice you do
[32:12] so again that's something that has just
[32:14] occurred to me in this video I haven't
[32:17] seen that in any particular book final
[32:21] bit on symbolism here this is the
[32:23] Emperor's shield and this is the
[32:26] Empress's shield we have a double-headed
[32:28] eagle in both and the fleur-de-lis in
[32:31] both so just looking at the Empress in
[32:36] this video in the beaks of the eagle we
[32:41] have don't think I can expand that any
[32:47] more without really blurring the image
[32:50] but we have a waxing moon sim which is
[32:58] the same as
[33:03] here so this is contained within the
[33:06] double bigs of the Eagle the white
[33:09] tincture is symbolic really of the
[33:12] sexual fluids of the female lubrication
[33:15] and Jack elation and because the White
[33:21] Eagle is the representing part the
[33:25] Empress we have the association with the
[33:31] Emperor here which has the red tincture
[33:34] which I'll go through when I do the
[33:36] Emperor so um that's that's it with the
[33:42] Alpha me so it's the purification of the
[33:44] soul through spiritual practice really
[33:46] that's what it comes down to so
[33:49] symbolism is over I'll go on to a brief
[33:52] section next which is the transition
[33:54] between the priests s and the Emperor's
[33:58] so this is a short section on the
[34:01] transition that's made between the
[34:03] priestess and the Empress so that the
[34:05] priestess represents and our alignment
[34:07] with our souls purpose which I talked
[34:10] about in the previous video
[34:12] she read she represents us living our
[34:16] daily life ruled around attaining our
[34:19] spiritual purpose rather than our
[34:22] material living but when the fool
[34:26] encounters the Empress she's taken a big
[34:32] step because he's now in greater
[34:34] recognition of what the essential nature
[34:36] of that spirit is which is love which
[34:39] talked about in his code a lot and
[34:41] that's much purer than personal love so
[34:46] at this stage The Fool may only have a
[34:47] glimpse of this quality and he still
[34:50] does not know his true identity but
[34:54] nevertheless it's another powerful
[34:56] realization to have so that sums up that
[35:01] transition and we'll now go on to the
[35:03] final session which is the application
[35:05] of
[35:06] empress in various positions of the
[35:09] celtic cross so this is our celtic cross
[35:14] spread here and we'll just move the
[35:17] Empress here to the first position so if
[35:20] if the Empress is the first card that
[35:23] appears on us spread it could be that
[35:25] well that's a dominant energy or
[35:28] direction of the spread and essentially
[35:30] the whole of the situation is being in
[35:33] touch with what fulfills you and the
[35:36] beauty of life because she represents
[35:38] Venus and being in touch with what
[35:42] fulfills you is all about rising above
[35:46] the mundane it's even if you're not
[35:49] doing any direct spiritual path it's
[35:52] trying to find something that you feel
[35:55] in love with that will bring you to a
[35:59] higher sense of love and achievement and
[36:05] acceptance of yourself
[36:08] number two possible obstacles so when
[36:15] the Empress crosses this is effectively
[36:18] the current challenge affecting your
[36:21] issue and the opposite to the first one
[36:24] sort of out of touch with what fulfills
[36:26] you and out of touch with your
[36:30] spirituality um other possible meanings
[36:37] in this position could be like for
[36:40] instance the couple could be odd with
[36:45] having children that could be another
[36:49] aspect that the Empress could represent
[36:54] the Empress in position three
[36:56] subconscious or unconscious influences
[37:01] negative thought patterns that could be
[37:03] holding you back from nurturing yourself
[37:05] properly and others unconscious
[37:09] influence entrances tend
[37:12] to be things that are unresolved recent
[37:22] past affecting our influence in this
[37:25] situation if we versed it could be
[37:27] issues around your mother or accepting
[37:29] love for mothers maybe we find it
[37:31] difficult to see that feeling unloved or
[37:33] even under fluffs marriage or
[37:35] relationship and really I should put
[37:39] this here in Reverse for that but are
[37:46] the same token if that is a prize
[37:50] it could mean appeared in time where
[37:53] you've got in touch with a spirituality
[37:54] and you've found this universal love and
[37:57] you can use that to to move forward into
[38:00] your current position so all of these
[38:02] are just examples so moving the Empress
[38:07] to position number five now hopes and
[38:10] goals to feel more loved and supported
[38:14] personally and to be able to open your
[38:16] heart spiritually and to know unlock the
[38:21] doorway between your life and the what
[38:25] is the essence of spirituality going
[38:27] back to that prism analogy short-term
[38:31] future so in position number six here at
[38:36] the top this is where it is on the
[38:39] Celtic Cross it could mean the birth of
[38:44] a child not but it might not be a
[38:46] physical birth it might be the start of
[38:50] something new so it's the birth of
[38:51] something but it's connection is with
[38:55] the heart and not a head so that is
[39:00] something which is connecting to your
[39:04] your sort of inner self where that
[39:06] spiritual path connects rather than it
[39:09] being an intellectual thing it's
[39:11] something it's gonna be very close to
[39:14] your desires again the Empress is all
[39:18] about trying to find your highest
[39:20] purpose
[39:24] God in position seven how we are
[39:29] affecting our situation or our
[39:31] self-image it could mean that we need to
[39:35] be empathic caring compassionate and
[39:38] loving and that might be a description
[39:42] of our nature or more likely if it's
[39:45] nailed down with the other cards in the
[39:48] spread it could be that you need to
[39:50] demonstrate those qualities in the
[39:53] situation at hand whether it be in the
[39:56] work environment in your personal life
[39:59] or another situation here again relates
[40:06] to love and and children that theme so
[40:15] we move on to position eight position
[40:19] eight is our environment how others are
[40:22] affecting our situation or our external
[40:24] environment and it could be that our
[40:27] partner is loving and supports us and
[40:30] that this or a particular person with
[40:33] those qualities are instrumental in
[40:36] supporting us in our life at this time
[40:39] again it could relate to work or a
[40:42] spiritual path or our personal life but
[40:51] those qualities are being coming to us
[40:54] from our our world rather than them
[40:58] being expressed through our self next we
[41:05] end up the Empress in position number 9
[41:07] which is guidance and warning this
[41:10] relates to all can relate to our
[41:12] meditation and spiritual practice it
[41:14] must be nurturing to us to us so it's
[41:21] looking at it from a different point of
[41:24] view if we're not feeling that love from
[41:27] our spiritual practice
[41:29] and with love being the key which is a
[41:34] thing that runs through this particular
[41:36] video then it could be the reason that
[41:42] is holding you back so it's getting in
[41:47] touch with following the spiritual path
[41:50] through the heart and lastly we have the
[41:55] Empress in position number 10 audio
[41:57] which is the long-term overall outcome
[41:59] and that is being at one with this
[42:01] Universal love finding and that
[42:04] connection of love as part and parcel of
[42:09] the spiritual path it's something you
[42:11] know that I've come across in meditation
[42:14] and seen within this light of creation
[42:19] that binds everything together so
[42:23] hopefully that helps again with the
[42:27] divination section here these are just
[42:29] examples just starting points for you to
[42:32] then go on and use to your own
[42:35] discretion okay I hope you've enjoyed
[42:38] the video thanks ever so much for
[42:39] watching your support is greatly
[42:41] appreciated and I'll see you for the
[42:44] next card not sure whether it's a minor
[42:46] or major arcana next
