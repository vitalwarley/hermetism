[00:06] [Music]
[00:08] hi everyone and welcome to this video on
[00:11] the Magus so we're following on from the
[00:13] fool in the previous video
[00:15] you've got the Toth Magus on the left
[00:18] here and it's right away counterpart on
[00:22] the right so the two looked very
[00:24] different even though the message in
[00:28] both of them is the same so we'll go
[00:32] through the divinatory meanings
[00:33] associated with the Magus a couple of
[00:36] these meanings are not commonly found in
[00:38] text books but they are very much
[00:41] associated with symbolism in this card
[00:44] so for those of you that follow the
[00:46] video in its entirety you'll see where
[00:48] those divinity meanings originate from
[00:53] so I'll do that next and then we'll go
[00:57] into the symbolism and philosophy of the
[01:01] Magus in detail looking at The Upright
[01:05] divinity meanings of the Magus so the
[01:12] first point is that you have all the
[01:14] skills and tools needed to move forward
[01:17] with something that you want to achieve
[01:19] and these are the objects around him the
[01:25] key is to be able to bring these skills
[01:27] together in the best possible way so
[01:30] that you have a maximum chance of
[01:32] success in what you do so it's
[01:34] harnessing your skills and focusing them
[01:38] in a productive manner because the Magus
[01:42] is all about creating things and being
[01:44] creative so we need to look at the
[01:47] content and purity of our thoughts
[01:50] because all actions have consequences
[01:54] what we put out eventually found its way
[01:56] back to us colored by everything that is
[01:59] touched along the way so it's a time to
[02:03] focus on our Bowl
[02:05] and what would practically need to do to
[02:06] get there and that's combining it with
[02:12] our best intentions we got back to the
[02:19] three of ones to virtue card for more
[02:25] detail on that you need to have the
[02:28] discipline and focus to translate your
[02:30] ideas into actions so he's bringing
[02:33] things down just as the right away card
[02:37] here we've got a focus of energy coming
[02:40] down into the world next one
[02:51] clear communication with others as
[02:54] needed at this time to make the best
[02:56] possible chance of success with your
[02:59] goals so the communication bit comes
[03:01] from the fact that the Magus is
[03:03] associated with mercury which does
[03:08] involve the quality of communication
[03:17] examine your skill set to make sure you
[03:20] are not under estimating or
[03:22] overestimating them in relation to your
[03:24] desired goal so the skill set again it's
[03:28] all everything that he creates with the
[03:32] objects around him and it's making sure
[03:34] you've got the right skill set for what
[03:35] you want to do and the need to bring
[03:40] spirituality into our lives
[03:42] the lemniscate above that's this which
[03:46] is more clear in the right away card and
[03:49] we got on the Left card here we've got
[03:52] as a serpent and figure eight
[04:02] so the lemniscate above his head shows a
[04:05] need to connect the spiritual quatre
[04:08] which is the first
[04:09] Sephiroth on the Tree of Life with the
[04:11] material the beam he walks yeah yeah so
[04:22] we can be a channel for spirit to flow
[04:25] through into our lives and finalize it
[04:28] and we have to separate out that which
[04:31] is truthful in our lives from that which
[04:33] is deceiving us this may be in the realm
[04:37] of our work relationships or spiritual
[04:39] path because the magician is essentially
[04:42] using the tools of creation and the
[04:45] creation is all an illusion anyway so it
[04:51] depends on whether what you create is in
[04:57] good virtue whoops again the three of
[04:59] ones or whether it's deceiving others is
[05:02] it for a higher purpose or is it
[05:05] something which is just going to be a
[05:08] selfish and sometimes destructive path
[05:13] that we can take so it's been as
[05:17] truthful to our inner core as what we
[05:21] can be and also also identifying others
[05:28] which may not be coming from such a pure
[05:31] purpose they might have self interests
[05:35] to our detriment
[05:37] so the makers reversed divinatory
[05:40] meanings using one skills to the
[05:44] detriment of others tricksters con men
[05:46] claiming to have skills they do not
[05:48] possess that's in the news quite a lot
[05:52] being out of touch with your own reality
[05:54] your not seeing your life and the world
[05:57] around you in a healthy way and you've
[05:59] lost insight and objectivity
[06:08] similar here creating situations that
[06:11] are of detriment to yourself and
[06:13] specifically our search path
[06:15] these may be worldly things are taking
[06:18] up too much of your time and are a
[06:19] distraction so in other words what
[06:21] you're creating in this card from the
[06:24] tools around you is not serving your
[06:26] higher purpose
[06:29] poor communication with us hampering
[06:32] your path forward and needs to improve
[06:37] you've lost the magic in your life which
[06:40] now seems to be mundane the inability or
[06:43] lacking inspiration to get to where you
[06:45] want to go so it's time to reassess your
[06:48] skillset and motivation and also not
[06:53] sharing enough of your spiritual
[06:55] insights with others who would be
[06:57] greatly helped if you were to open your
[07:00] ability to channel spiritual realization
[07:03] so this is saying that the Magus is a
[07:06] channel for spirituality and you're not
[07:08] using your channel enough okay that's
[07:13] enough on the divinity meanings we'll go
[07:16] and apply things to a Celtic Cross at
[07:17] the end of the video but we'll go and
[07:18] have a look at some of the history and
[07:23] the deeper aspects of this card so we've
[07:27] seen the ride away version of the Magus
[07:30] on the right here there's also been many
[07:35] evil representations of this card we
[07:40] have the juggler on the Left which
[07:42] crowley says is the least satisfactory
[07:47] in the medieval pack so that tells you
[07:49] what he thinks of this title and the
[07:52] french version is based on this they're
[07:54] very similar so what he's done is abated
[08:02] The Magus with lots of symbolism which
[08:05] is representative of his position on the
[08:11] Tree of Life and his position within the
[08:16] major arcana there were three different
[08:19] designs of the Magus that were created
[08:24] by Freda Harris and only the left one
[08:26] here was approved for the pact the other
[08:29] two discarded but just thought I'd show
[08:32] you these so the first thing we need to
[08:35] consider when looking at the mangas is
[08:38] who is he so we'll have a look at that
[08:41] next the Magus is Hermes Trismegistus
[08:48] sounds a bit of a mouthful but tri
[08:51] meaning three and Trismegistus meaning
[08:54] thrice great and this probably refers to
[08:58] his qualities which could say as mercury
[09:01] who is a messenger of the gods and a
[09:04] communicator between the gods and man
[09:08] and we can see this again this
[09:10] communication between heaven and earth
[09:16] he's also to do with wisdom which comes
[09:21] from source and obviously intellect and
[09:25] writing are also attributed to Thoth as
[09:29] well and we've got magical and
[09:31] alchemical qualities which are based
[09:36] around Hermes so we've got three
[09:41] different cultures here we've got Roman
[09:43] which is associated with mercury a
[09:47] messenger between the gods and mortals
[09:50] Crowley says the word of creation whose
[09:53] speech is silence
[10:01] if you want any more information on that
[10:04] with our meditation group the Alliance
[10:08] and meditation is all about meditating
[10:11] on the silent words or the inner and
[10:17] sound and we've got an Egyptian culture
[10:21] here which is tossed here the head of an
[10:24] Ibis bird that has a powers of
[10:26] concentration to stand on one leg and
[10:29] Crowley says that this is quite
[10:32] evidently a symbol of the meditative
[10:34] spirit because it requires the quality
[10:37] of concentration which again helps the
[10:40] Magus channel the spiritual energy from
[10:43] above
[10:44] again it's evident that Crowley just
[10:46] talked about meditation there so we've
[10:51] got Hermes Trismegistus coming from
[10:55] Roman Egyptian and the last one is Greek
[10:59] which is Hermes and associates will help
[11:03] me and magic and if you look up a
[11:05] picture of Hermes on the internet you'll
[11:07] get something like this because again
[11:09] it's the quite often a different name
[11:12] attributed to the same deity so that
[11:16] gives you a grounding of who the Magus
[11:21] is supposed to represent and the culture
[11:24] behind that so we'll now have a look at
[11:27] how the Magus translates on to the tree
[11:31] of life on the Tree of Life The Magus
[11:36] occupies the path between Quetta
[11:39] and Bing are the Minor Arcana associated
[11:43] with the individual Sephiroth but the
[11:47] majors occupy the paths between the
[11:50] Sephirah we looked at the full in a
[11:53] previous video and the name for this
[11:56] particular path between Quetta and achma
[11:58] or quatre pockmarks is the path of
[12:03] scintillating intelligence but the Magus
[12:07] occupies Path number 12 which is the
[12:10] intelligence
[12:11] of transparency and this is ruled by
[12:16] mercury it lies between as I said cata
[12:20] which is formlessness
[12:22] and Bernard which is the like the womb
[12:26] of form if you like it's where form
[12:29] starts to get created so in order to
[12:34] actually look and understand a little
[12:37] bit about this path number 12 here we'll
[12:41] just take a definition of transparency
[12:43] which is something that allows light to
[12:45] pass through it so objects behind can be
[12:50] seen distinctly so in other words it's
[12:55] like being a channel and we've mentioned
[12:57] that a few times in this video already
[13:00] and here we have in the right away
[13:02] version and the soft version here The
[13:06] Magus acting as a channel for spiritual
[13:09] energy coming through and we'll see how
[13:13] it connects with the fool a little bit
[13:14] later on so it implies that the magician
[13:23] has got to be pure enough to not distort
[13:27] this energy coming down from spirit in
[13:31] other words he acts as a clear channel
[13:33] for this energy looking at it in terms
[13:40] of the microcosm in terms of his
[13:43] personality in terms of his daily life
[13:46] it means him connecting with his
[13:51] spiritual source and channeling that in
[13:53] the purest way possible so that his
[13:57] personality doesn't distort the original
[14:00] message and on a macrocosmic level in
[14:04] terms of the universe and what the Tree
[14:06] of Life represents universally in terms
[14:10] of creation of matter here from spirit
[14:13] at the top
[14:15] we have the fiery intelligence coming
[14:19] from the fill and that is focused here
[14:23] by the magician we see in the
[14:26] right-of-way card here we have the
[14:28] finger pointing here that in palmistry
[14:33] is actually the Jupiter finger which is
[14:35] to do with authority vision and
[14:37] influence and these are all things which
[14:40] can be attributed to like a spiritual
[14:43] channel or a spiritual teacher so again
[14:48] this is some of the hidden symbolism in
[14:51] the rider-waite deck but the amethyst
[14:55] version again is very similar with
[15:00] regards to that particular message so
[15:03] Crowley States in his book itas that The
[15:05] Magus is duality and therefore he
[15:09] represents both truth and falsehood
[15:12] wisdom and folly and this is because as
[15:16] I as I mentioned anything to do with the
[15:18] creation is an illusion and it's how we
[15:20] use that illusion which defines who we
[15:24] are and this is why the Magus can be
[15:28] also represented as a trickster
[15:30] trickster because he gives birth to
[15:33] illusion beginning in banaji which is
[15:37] the birth of form and he's using that
[15:43] illusion for his own selfish ends and to
[15:47] the detriment possibly of others I'll
[15:52] now look at the Hebrew and astrological
[15:55] attributes of the Magus so this is the
[15:58] bottom of the card here and we have the
[16:02] astrological tribute of mercury and the
[16:08] Hebrew attribution is Beth which means
[16:12] house so in terms of mercury the
[16:16] Egyptians called the god mercury Toth
[16:19] and it was attributed the writer of many
[16:23] books in science and the
[16:25] Venter of writing so that's all about
[16:28] the written word and communication and
[16:31] philosophical mind it makes them
[16:34] competent with words language and speech
[16:37] and all of these hold a certain of
[16:39] vibration within them and that is very
[16:42] much transferred to the qualities of the
[16:46] Magus in terms of its Hebrew
[16:49] contribution better meaning house
[16:52] this can be an inner or outer thing an
[16:54] outer house actually takes a lot of
[16:56] planning let's get a lot of writing
[16:58] looking at geometry of that sort of
[17:01] things so it's constructing things just
[17:03] as the Magus himself is constructing
[17:05] things from the objects around him so
[17:09] the architect builds the house but in
[17:12] biblical terms the house is also related
[17:14] to or is representative of the human
[17:17] body like my mansion has many rooms that
[17:22] sort of thing and so it can be an
[17:25] internal construct as well so it is
[17:28] making the Magus a going back to this
[17:32] notion of a channel so he's constructing
[17:36] his his body his his aura to receive
[17:42] spirit by his spiritual practices the
[17:51] Hebrew letter Burt had it as a numerical
[17:55] attribution of two signaling duality and
[17:58] creation and therefore illusion so the
[18:01] Magus has to complete all of this tasks
[18:03] and the fool has to travel his journey
[18:07] despite the illusion of duality so the
[18:10] full steps out of his comfort zone and
[18:13] goes into the world and has to cope with
[18:15] all the world has to throw at him in
[18:18] order for him to achieve his
[18:19] enlightenment
[18:24] we'll now have a look at the symbolism
[18:27] of the Tov Magus in the first thing to
[18:29] say is that the fool is unde raja'na s--
[18:31] in other words he has no specific gender
[18:34] and he's like the fool in that attribute
[18:38] and that's because both the Magus and
[18:40] fool occupy paths involving the
[18:45] Sephiroth scatter which is
[18:47] undifferentiated spirit so he represents
[18:51] that through his lack of a specific
[18:55] gender
[18:57] he also juggles 8 objects around him the
[19:02] disc here the censor the doll Phoenix
[19:08] wand the pen scroll winged egg cup and
[19:20] tiger so we'll have a little look at
[19:24] these in slightly more detail the sensor
[19:30] is a vessel for burning incense and is
[19:33] used in religious ceremonies and that
[19:40] represents fire the cup here is really
[19:46] of a Greek style which represents the
[19:49] water the dagger represents the air
[19:57] and here we've got the disc which has
[20:02] the eight fold star of mercury the disc
[20:05] represents earth and it's an eight fold
[20:09] star because number eight in terms of
[20:15] the Sephiroth on the Tree of Life is in
[20:19] relation to HOD ruled by mercury so
[20:22] that's again a link in with the mercury
[20:25] in terms of its astrological attribution
[20:30] so we've covered the four elements the
[20:33] fire the water the air and the earth
[20:35] will now have a look at the wind egg so
[20:40] here we have the winged egg and this
[20:44] represents the fifth element or spirit
[20:46] and it's also known as the Orphic egg
[20:48] and appears also in the lovers card here
[20:50] you would like a serpent wrapped around
[20:53] it
[20:53] and it represents the nothingness out of
[20:56] which everything is born quite like
[20:59] Keter as we've explained
[21:09] next up are the stylus or pen and scroll
[21:12] and that relates to Toth who we said was
[21:17] attributed writings communication speech
[21:23] that sort of thing and he demonstrates
[21:26] the intellect and will of the Magus as
[21:29] it communicates through writing this
[21:33] again links in with mercury a planet
[21:36] representing communication and also the
[21:38] endless movement of creation and that's
[21:42] why meditation is important because we
[21:43] can get a sense of stillness as we move
[21:45] closer and closer to spirit so the
[21:49] stillness of meditation is very
[21:50] different to the movement of the mind
[21:56] the last thing here is the Phoenix wand
[22:00] of double power and we can see that in
[22:02] the actual Golden Dawn real-life version
[22:09] of it and this is really symbolic of the
[22:13] power of Horus the Lord of the new Aeon
[22:16] and also if you think about it Phoenix
[22:20] is to do with resurrection and that's
[22:23] like related to the spiritual path
[22:26] because it's following the path of the
[22:31] filter completion the fool begins his
[22:33] process of resurrection as soon as he
[22:36] steps out of his comfort zone and steps
[22:40] onto his spiritual path in the Magus so
[22:45] it's like a the esoteric interpretation
[22:49] of a New Age Christian so just took
[22:56] these objects one by one and just gave
[23:03] you a bit more detail on those but
[23:05] that's where they were they're just
[23:08] surrounding the central Magus figure
[23:10] here
[23:12] the Phoenix one here also being yellow
[23:15] is associated with the sixth Sephiroth
[23:21] on the Tree of Life - peretta Buddhism
[23:23] which is ruled by the Sun and indeed the
[23:25] close connection of this card can be
[23:28] seen by the Sunburst here I think I've
[23:31] got a close-up of that yes here it is
[23:36] here's his winged sandals here and you
[23:41] can see just the Rays of the Sun and a
[23:45] central yellow disc here it's not so
[23:50] obvious when you go to the original
[23:56] dimensions here so the next thing I want
[23:59] to chat about in regards to the Magus
[24:02] symbolism is the caduceus which is here
[24:05] and the wand which starts at the top
[24:08] here also becomes the beam which he
[24:11] walks upon here so we'll have a look at
[24:15] that in close-up we have the Eye of
[24:22] Horus here with the Dove we've got the
[24:28] shaft of the wand which stretched
[24:34] stretches to his feet as I mentioned
[24:36] we've got a serpent here with the crown
[24:40] of Quetta you can just about see that
[24:42] that's a point a bit pointed bit on the
[24:44] surfing here which is the crown of
[24:46] Quetta the first Sephiroth on the Tree
[24:50] of Life and here we have a serpent with
[24:52] the throne shaped crown of Isis and here
[24:55] you can see like a throne here on top of
[24:58] Isis and can you see this here again a
[25:01] little throne like representation of
[25:07] that on the serpent to the left this is
[25:11] very hard to pick out again it's another
[25:13] reason why I get the larger version of
[25:16] the cards because you can see these in a
[25:18] little bit more detail
[25:23] this whole thing of this whole structure
[25:26] really is about fertility and creation
[25:30] the Dove which is defending here is the
[25:36] same as spirit descending into creation
[25:38] it's also linked to the Empress card and
[25:42] the Empress is ruled by Venus so she
[25:46] manifests love and fertility so here we
[25:52] have the Empress card with the Dove and
[25:54] on this particular one the the bottom
[25:57] has been cropped off but she represents
[26:01] she willed by Venus so therefore we have
[26:07] the male phallus and this female element
[26:12] to the card as well meaning that the
[26:16] caduceus is actually complete it's also
[26:24] outlined in yellow and that represents
[26:28] the valve of the Tetragrammaton which
[26:31] the product of the union of the yard
[26:34] which is the phallus and the hay which
[26:37] is the Dove and also the wings of Isis
[26:41] for those of you that are unfamiliar
[26:43] with the Tetragrammaton is the relates
[26:46] to the name Jehovah wih the H the yard
[26:52] here represented by the the wand of the
[26:58] caduceus and here the female bit the hey
[27:01] was by the Dove and wings of Isis and
[27:04] the valve here which is that the Sun
[27:09] that's created from the union of the
[27:12] mother and the father
[27:14] so the yad relates to fire here we've
[27:17] got water on the vamp related to the air
[27:22] that translates into the properties of
[27:25] the Magus as he takes that which is
[27:29] around him and produces something which
[27:32] is created creative and different and
[27:35] this is the same here you've got the
[27:37] yard and the hay and they create
[27:38] something different out of their union
[27:40] so it's just that process this sort of
[27:44] cosmic process of creation acting out
[27:46] within the actions of the Magus going
[27:51] back to the original diagram here we've
[27:53] got one serpent here with the crown of
[27:55] cata and the other one here with the
[27:58] throne shaped crown of Isis and that's
[28:02] the female here and these are a
[28:05] representation of the path of the Magus
[28:09] on the Tree of Life
[28:13] so you've got Qatar here and that crown
[28:16] and Ben are represented by the crown of
[28:19] Isis by the serpent on the left Guetta
[28:24] and Bill are also seen within the card
[28:27] itself at the here we have the white
[28:29] light of Quetta notice none of the lines
[28:33] of the background go through that these
[28:36] are sort of lines of creation the the
[28:38] world of form when you start getting
[28:40] division of space and none of them
[28:42] penetrate that because it's indivisible
[28:45] and same here for Ben ah he you've got
[28:50] the black thing of Ben are here and they
[28:54] go into Ben are and it's out of Ben are
[28:56] and on another process that they
[28:58] actually become more involved in the
[29:01] formed side of creation and so he's
[29:04] walking the path here this this plank
[29:06] this staff between the purity of Quetta
[29:11] and the beginning of form in Ben are
[29:16] here and the serpents represent that by
[29:18] their different crowns
[29:23] the other thing to say is just this
[29:25] lemniscate here which we've already
[29:26] mentioned this figure of 8 the infinity
[29:29] sign representing the creation and we
[29:33] could see that in a diagram the
[29:36] Crowley's done in the book of Thoth and
[29:41] here is a form of the lemniscate here
[29:45] and notice that this is related to the
[29:49] tree of life with Keter at the top here
[29:51] mulku down at the bottom the
[29:54] intersection here being temperate yes
[29:57] odd here and you've got the various
[30:01] different pillars here and here I put
[30:09] the original Tree of Life diagram beside
[30:11] it so we have that as I say the getter
[30:13] here B now would be 3 hawkmoth 2 and
[30:18] this would be the path of the Magus here
[30:21] so the caduceus is representative of the
[30:26] creation of the cosmos we have just a
[30:33] little bit of the symbolism remaining
[30:35] here we've got these winged sandals here
[30:39] and here and those are attributed to
[30:43] mercury as we saw in a previous slide
[30:47] here is mercury with these winged
[30:50] sandals here this one's hard to see but
[30:55] it's a sandal strap and it's got the
[30:58] skin of a serpent here it's very similar
[31:01] to the serpents at the top and the
[31:06] sandal strap being like a serpent
[31:08] shedding its skin suggests again living
[31:12] life anew the food has decided to change
[31:16] his life forever and walk into the
[31:17] illusion of matter to find his higher
[31:19] self and this is like the renewal of
[31:23] life that comes with that process so
[31:25] that's under the representation of that
[31:30] step that the fool makes to the first of
[31:36] the major economist on his journey I
[31:42] haven't mentioned this ape here sign of
[31:45] us there is some debate about the roles
[31:49] that he plays some saying that he does
[31:52] represent a higher form but certainly in
[31:55] the Magus card he represents the
[31:58] distortion of the word here he
[32:02] represents the distortion of the word of
[32:04] the Magus and again that's another form
[32:09] of illusion but as Crowley says
[32:14] manifestation implies illusion and he is
[32:17] just another pictorial representation of
[32:21] how this energy from Quetta going into
[32:26] been ah here can be distorted as he
[32:29] walks along the path here he's also seen
[32:34] later in the fortune card as Herman
[32:37] nubes climbing his way of the wheel but
[32:39] we'll go into that in more detail when
[32:41] we get to that particular card
[32:48] herma nubes is also associated with
[32:52] mercury began linking us into the mangas
[32:57] card so I think that's it a bit and
[33:00] that's about it for the symbolism are
[33:01] now going to go on to the full term agus
[33:04] transition that I've talked a little bit
[33:06] about that so there's not a lot further
[33:08] I want to add in terms of the transition
[33:11] from The Fool to the Magus we can look
[33:14] at it in a cosmological perspective path
[33:20] eleven scintillating intelligence which
[33:23] the fool occupies path 12 the
[33:26] intelligence of transparency which the
[33:28] Magus occupies so that is in terms of
[33:33] path 11 that's essentially the fiery
[33:34] intelligence is the intelligence within
[33:36] the spiritual vibrations coming from
[33:38] Quetta or the source at the top of the
[33:41] Tree of Life and the intelligence of
[33:43] transparency is that channel that the
[33:49] Magus creates so that that energy is not
[33:55] distorted in any way and it just passes
[33:56] simply through him so in this
[33:59] cosmological explanation of the
[34:02] transition we're not talking about
[34:03] people we're talking about the formation
[34:05] of creation if we're talking about what
[34:08] is happening in the microcosm in other
[34:11] words what's happening within the the
[34:18] spiritual path of the fool we can say
[34:22] that the fool has left his freedom
[34:25] living carefree life and that protected
[34:30] bubble of innocent or innocence as burst
[34:33] and he swapped it for the magician who
[34:36] is someone who has to deal with the
[34:38] illusion of creation all of its forms
[34:40] all of its illusions and Karma's and
[34:42] everything that goes with it and he has
[34:45] to create that something out of that
[34:48] illusion that is gonna be useful for him
[34:51] on his journey to enlightenment
[34:55] and that is the crux of it so we'll now
[35:01] move on to the section on divination and
[35:09] its relationship to the Celtic cross
[35:15] we've returned to divination in the last
[35:18] part of the video and we'll look at the
[35:20] make us through the Celtic cross so if
[35:22] it lands as a first card then we're
[35:26] looking at the dominant energy of the
[35:28] spread so position one would really mean
[35:33] that it's focusing the quieren on their
[35:39] goals and there's a need to review their
[35:42] skill set and use them effectively to
[35:45] reach where they want to go it's really
[35:48] like pooling their resources in the best
[35:50] possible way and not letting their
[35:54] energies scatter but to concentrate on
[35:57] the task in hand and also to give some
[36:00] confidence that they have the necessary
[36:03] skills or the ability or the ability to
[36:05] learn new skills to achieve what they
[36:08] want position to where the Magus would
[36:15] be in a crossing position so this is a
[36:17] possible obstacle to card one because it
[36:21] crosses and obscures the energy of the
[36:25] first card so it's liable to be some
[36:29] something to do with the reversed
[36:31] meaning of the Magus such as the
[36:33] Aquarian has a goal or purpose which is
[36:38] outlined in card number one but they're
[36:40] creating detrimental situations that are
[36:43] taking them further away from the goals
[36:45] it could be due to miscommunication with
[36:48] other people or just the things that
[36:52] they're putting their energies into I
[36:53] just not productive so that's called
[36:56] position number two position three
[37:00] subconscious influences could mean that
[37:02] the query is subconsciously wanting to
[37:05] be more in touch with their spirit
[37:07] two paths so that daily life is more
[37:10] enriched and so they've become more of a
[37:14] channel for spiritual inspiration with
[37:20] it being in the subconscious part here
[37:21] it could mean that the reason they
[37:23] haven't done that is that sacrifices
[37:25] that are needed to obtain that lifestyle
[37:27] and those realizations may be
[37:30] off-putting for them to make and that
[37:36] could involve lifestyle changes
[37:39] involving anything from alcohol to
[37:42] friendships the list goes on but you
[37:46] know the spiritual path comes with a
[37:47] price so card number for what recent
[37:54] past influencing this situation if the
[37:58] Magus is reversed for instance it could
[38:00] mean that this person has been deceived
[38:02] why someone mentioned the Magus has been
[38:04] like the trickster and perhaps that's
[38:06] knocked their confidence to move forward
[38:09] and achieve their goals which have been
[38:12] position number 10 position number five
[38:18] here the Kremlin's hopes and goals now
[38:21] the Magus here could indicate that they
[38:23] may be dissatisfied with their work and
[38:26] they need to make more use of their
[38:28] skills perhaps they're feeling
[38:30] undervalued and that they're not really
[38:32] using their full skill set so their
[38:34] hopes and goals would be to actually put
[38:36] these into a much better and much more
[38:38] creative and indeed maybe even financial
[38:42] a greater with a greater financial
[38:46] return for what they're doing but the
[38:50] main thing would be to use their
[38:52] skillset in a much more creative and
[38:55] supporting way for the life that they
[38:57] want to lead the Magus appearing in
[39:03] composition number six in near future
[39:06] this could indicate the need to make
[39:10] sure that your communication with others
[39:12] is good and that you learn as much as
[39:14] you can
[39:16] to move forward with purpose to achieve
[39:19] your goals so that is like using the
[39:21] concentration and the intellect of the
[39:24] of the Magus to find out what it is you
[39:28] need to do to achieve your long-term
[39:30] goals but also make sure your
[39:32] communication with others is just as
[39:35] effective
[39:38] Magus in position number eight how the
[39:41] equivalent is affecting their situation
[39:45] using their skills in a focused way
[39:48] harnessing them to get the best possible
[39:51] outcome this could refer to someone who
[39:53] is studying for example or training for
[39:55] a new skill and qualification position
[40:01] number 8 for the makers here how others
[40:04] are affecting your situation what we
[40:06] talked about the Magus as being a
[40:08] channel for spirit so it could be in
[40:10] relation to the current receiving
[40:14] spiritual insight from a teacher who
[40:17] helps them with a spiritual path so the
[40:19] Magus has a wide range of roles that
[40:22] exist on in very different spheres
[40:27] position nine for the Magus your
[40:31] guidance advice or warning not to be too
[40:34] scattered in your goals maintain a clear
[40:37] focus on one thing and let that have
[40:41] your undivided attention so it's that
[40:43] focus of concentration again so the
[40:49] Magus in position number ten the last
[40:51] card or long-term outcome and that is
[40:55] manifesting what you want through skill
[40:58] and focus and that's going to be the key
[41:00] to success so spiritually it's about
[41:04] creating an effective process of
[41:06] spreading your spiritual path for
[41:08] instance pulling your skills to achieve
[41:12] your end successfully
[41:17] so unless reverse the Magus in this
[41:19] position is very good because it points
[41:24] also possibly to being even a spiritual
[41:27] teacher bringing band the light of
[41:30] spirit into one's daily life and also
[41:34] being a role model for others I'm taking
[41:38] on more responsibility and being able to
[41:40] demonstrate that in a positive way so
[41:44] position 10 for the Magus is very good
[41:47] so that completes this video again these
[41:50] aren't just example situations on the
[41:54] application of this card so we'll next
[41:57] move on to the priestess
[42:05] [Music]
