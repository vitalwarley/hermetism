[00:04] [Music]
[00:09] hello there and thanks for joining me in
[00:12] this videocast for the fortune card or
[00:17] in the right away deck it's called the
[00:19] Wheel of Fortune and this is really just
[00:22] a glyph of how the universe works in
[00:27] terms of its ebbs and flows and the
[00:30] energies that keep it in motion perhaps
[00:34] what's sometimes lacking in the
[00:37] descriptions of this card is the fact
[00:39] that the central bit here which doesn't
[00:42] move is also a very important aspect of
[00:45] the card because it's that sense of
[00:47] centeredness and stillness which gives
[00:50] us some detached rent from the activity
[00:53] of the rest of the card
[00:54] a family's card a little bit tricky to
[00:57] get to grips with when I was first
[01:00] looking at the toss deck because you've
[01:02] got quite a lot of different sim figures
[01:07] around the outside here which not always
[01:10] immediately clear but we'll we'll talk
[01:13] about these one by one so I'm hoping to
[01:17] do a card per week now and get this
[01:19] series finished off so hopefully we'll
[01:23] be able to get a conclusion to this toss
[01:27] series pretty soon okay and I'll see you
[01:30] in the next section
[01:33] oK we've recovered to the position of
[01:36] the wheel of fortune on the Tree of Life
[01:38] it's located between hesed which is the
[01:43] fourth sufferer here Sephiroth and nets
[01:46] are which is the seventh so hare said
[01:49] which is just above the supernal
[01:52] triangle where you have a lot of
[01:54] spiritual energy coming down it's
[01:56] situated here and it collects the energy
[01:59] from these three as it comes from
[02:01] Boehner and the lightning strike there
[02:03] it's associated with bestowing goodness
[02:11] it's to do with structure justice law
[02:18] but all for the betterment of mankind in
[02:25] its highest aspect so it's like
[02:27] bestowing goodness on creation and this
[02:30] just links in with the this notion that
[02:35] in the card itself with Jupiter ruling
[02:41] that there is a sense that creation acts
[02:45] in our best interests even though it may
[02:49] not seem that way this card is quite
[02:52] complex in the sense that it can relate
[02:54] to karmic events of the past so we're
[02:57] not just looking at the present here
[02:59] we're looking at the Wheel of Life and
[03:01] so we know the Wheel of Life just not
[03:03] just apply to this lifetime but we'll
[03:05] explain how trying to explain more about
[03:07] that in the next section so that's one
[03:13] aspect of its position on the Tree of
[03:16] Life that hurt and that's acting trying
[03:18] to act and see life in its highest
[03:20] aspects no psyche is to do with the
[03:23] emotions and source of victory
[03:26] it ties in with MSN in the sense that
[03:34] it's it's trying to live our lives that
[03:39] will in a way that will fulfill us so
[03:42] that when we are revolving on this Wheel
[03:45] of Life we do get something out of it
[03:48] emotionally that is fulfilling and so I
[03:52] mean that's that can also be like
[03:55] drowning in the emotions as well but
[03:57] we're looking at the major arcana in
[04:01] terms of things in their most purified
[04:06] aspects so with this card we have a
[04:11] sense of us acting in the best possible
[04:18] way and also to try and get as much as
[04:22] life as we can
[04:24] that will emotionally fulfill us and and
[04:29] that life will fulfill other people as
[04:32] well so it's not just a sense of I was
[04:37] trying to get the most of it for what we
[04:39] can get is also about service to others
[04:42] so that sums up the position of the
[04:47] fortune card on the Tree of Life I
[04:50] haven't seen that particular description
[04:53] given in many books so that's basically
[04:56] I've meditated on that and
[05:00] what seems relevant to me with regards
[05:03] to to its position there on the tree
[05:06] okay we'll go to the next section which
[05:09] will be about the Hebrew attribution of
[05:12] this card the Hebrew Association of this
[05:17] card is CAF which is spelled ke a pH and
[05:22] CAF essentially means the palm of the
[05:27] hand or fist and it's the wheel that
[05:30] turns its or it's the hand that turns
[05:32] the wheel rather we can see on the
[05:35] diagram close-up on the wheel of
[05:39] fortune' that here we are we have the
[05:42] fist here this does imply that our
[05:46] destinies in our own hands in a sense
[05:51] the I'd also just like to mention that
[05:55] the palm of the hand also is related to
[06:03] palmistry and the lines on the palm are
[06:07] said to be like an imprint of the life
[06:10] path of the soul so we have this again
[06:16] I'd the idea of destiny and the Wheel of
[06:19] Fortune and say for those that are
[06:24] interested I've got links on the in the
[06:26] article on my website linking to
[06:30] articles on karma and destiny the fate
[06:34] of the soul that sort of things so for
[06:36] those that want to pursue that you can
[06:40] just click on the on the links there
[06:42] there the other attribute of this card
[06:46] is the astrological one which we've
[06:49] mentioned which is Jupiter and this
[06:51] essentially bestows growth expansion a
[06:58] good fortune
[07:01] so there is a sense that this card does
[07:04] work for our best interest even though
[07:07] some lessons in life may be very
[07:09] difficult to fit into that particular
[07:13] framework by the time that we're
[07:16] experiencing them so perhaps we'll learn
[07:19] a little bit more about the Wheel of
[07:21] Fortune when we and karma and things
[07:24] like that when we look in the next
[07:26] section which is to do with the
[07:29] symbolism contained in the card looking
[07:34] at the symbology of the card we'll start
[07:36] at the very top here you have this
[07:40] circle type appearance here
[07:44] I'll bring the card down it's not quite
[07:46] in view that's better
[07:49] and we've got that like the and this is
[07:52] the cosmic clock this is the universal
[07:54] aspect of life here and the goddess
[08:00] tweet who we see in the Aeon card which
[08:05] is the Crowley equivalent to the
[08:07] judgment card in the wait deck in this
[08:11] cosmic clock we have a ten pointed star
[08:13] in the middle and on the outside we have
[08:17] various different shapes and brightness
[08:20] of stars for instance some are dark such
[08:25] as these and we've got some lighter ones
[08:27] these ones around the outside are all
[08:30] five-pointed stars and that relates to
[08:33] man and the pentagram fist man's
[08:34] fivefold nature it's the crisis nail the
[08:42] five wounds which I've gotten done
[08:45] articles on and that sort of thing so
[08:47] it's related to man but number 10 here
[08:51] reflects the ten pointed star in the
[08:53] middle of the actual Wheel of Life
[08:55] so with this card we've got the axiom as
[09:00] above so below so
[09:02] man is a reflection of God and God is so
[09:06] the highest aspect of man and that's
[09:10] essentially what the journey through the
[09:12] major arcana is about it's a fool's
[09:14] journey back to God also relevant is the
[09:21] fact that Crowley says in the book of
[09:23] the law that every man and woman is a
[09:24] star so all of these stars are unique
[09:27] they're all slightly different from each
[09:29] other and that represents the uniqueness
[09:32] of our individuality as we incarnate the
[09:41] number-10 here also refers to a sense of
[09:44] completion it refers to mal kutia which
[09:47] is the final Sephiroth the one that's
[09:50] further away from Quetta and it's the
[09:52] most grounded of energy so that number
[09:54] 10 implies that this card relates to our
[09:56] everyday world how a most tangible world
[10:07] ok so on to the next next but here
[10:17] we'll talk about is these three
[10:19] characters around the wheel itself so
[10:23] we'll start with the first one here on
[10:26] top and that's the Sphinx there these
[10:30] three represent the three gunas of the
[10:33] three qualities that make up the
[10:34] universe in Hindu philosophy so Crowley
[10:39] was very much for integrating east and
[10:42] west and just seeing the universality in
[10:45] all of these various different religions
[10:50] and philosophies I think I've got as my
[10:55] yam title on my website is many voices
[10:58] one truth and and this is this would
[11:02] very much cover on describe what
[11:05] Crowley's trying to turn this card so
[11:07] we'll take these things first as Fink's
[11:11] is Egyptian most of the other characters
[11:15] are Greek with the Sphinx it represents
[11:18] throwing the element of sulfur and
[11:28] sulfur is quite an explosive element
[11:31] it's got a lot of energy to it so
[11:34] despite the fact that the Sphinx carries
[11:36] a sword here which would imply some
[11:41] correspondence with mercury in fact it
[11:43] isn't the character associated mercury
[11:47] the fact that the Sphinx is related to
[11:50] sulfur also ties it in with the emperor
[11:53] because we looked at the emperor in a
[11:55] previous video so this is the active
[12:00] part of the creation the explosive one
[12:04] the creative bit of the cycle on to the
[12:09] next character got Typhon here who
[12:11] carries the inverted egg and he has like
[12:16] a serpentine tail here Typhon is to do
[12:24] with death and stagnation is almost the
[12:28] opposite of sulfur and is associated
[12:30] with salt and we saw salt in the Empress
[12:36] so the fact that he carries an inverted
[12:39] ank
[12:39] obstinately rank represents life motion
[12:42] the universe that sort of thing and so
[12:44] the the fact that inverted implies that
[12:47] he contradicts the principles of life he
[12:50] contradicts moving forward and he
[12:53] represents that part of our life which
[12:55] can stagnate and not be creative
[13:00] it represents the time that we are stuck
[13:05] the serpentine tail links them in with
[13:09] hell which is essentially a religious
[13:12] connotation for the mind and the mind
[13:16] obviously cannot see God so it links in
[13:22] with ending philosophy there as well
[13:27] okay we will move on to the third
[13:32] character there which is the probably
[13:34] the most ambiguous one because he's a
[13:39] hybrid he's a mixture of two characters
[13:42] and this character is called herman
[13:44] abyss again i've got all these in my
[13:47] notes on the website so he represents a
[13:51] variation the simian form of the god
[13:54] Anubis who normally looks like that
[14:06] so hem Anubis is a combination of Anubis
[14:09] and Hermes Hermes is associated work
[14:14] with mercury so this is where mercury
[14:16] comes in and these two gods are are
[14:19] associated with the function of being a
[14:20] psycho pump and a psycho pump is
[14:24] something that acts as a mediator
[14:27] between the living and the dead and
[14:30] essentially acts as a guide for souls of
[14:33] the Dead
[14:34] through the underworld as we saw in the
[14:38] we saw a little bit of a nice thought
[14:40] card and also in the three of cups my
[14:47] notes on the three cups also talked
[14:49] about Hades so Anubis is the Egyptian
[14:57] god of mummification and the weighing of
[14:59] the heart ritual and therefore as we saw
[15:04] in the diagram here it's like the the
[15:09] weighing of the heart and it's some sort
[15:12] of assessment before that soul it is
[15:16] this is passed on so all the characters
[15:22] in this quarter Greek in origin apart
[15:24] from the Sphinx
[15:27] we also have at the top of the card the
[15:31] easiest lightning bolts thunder bolts
[15:35] there and this links in with seus being
[15:42] a what's called a Demiurge a Demiurge is
[15:46] essentially someone who thinks their
[15:48] self created and therefore they don't
[15:51] have anything that's higher than them
[15:53] and but in fact there is much higher
[15:55] than them so it's like a deluded god so
[16:01] perhaps the farthest they could get to
[16:04] his head on the tree of life here
[16:05] because this supernal triangle here is
[16:08] all about unity of spirit where ego
[16:11] dissolves identity it dissolves so they
[16:14] would never know anything on the higher
[16:17] aspect of the Tree of Life here so how
[16:20] does this link in with the meaning of
[16:21] the card
[16:22] well Zaius was known for meddling with
[16:25] the affairs of humans and you see the
[16:28] Thunderbolts coming down from the stars
[16:30] here so in a sense he's attacking Typhon
[16:33] here which is the element of associated
[16:38] with salt and stagnation so that it is
[16:43] almost like this the influence of
[16:46] Jupiter and that and positively the
[16:48] expansion is trying to get rid of the
[16:52] the negative aspects of the wheel and
[16:55] just move our life forward here
[17:00] and that's basically how that links in
[17:05] with Greek mythology so he medals with
[17:11] the Karma of men fortune in some ways is
[17:16] said to be blowing the wheel sort of
[17:18] spins and stops and random ways which
[17:20] can mess up our lives but again this is
[17:22] a very complex subject and for those
[17:24] that want a bit more information on
[17:26] Karma then as I said I do have links to
[17:29] that on in the notes
[17:35] another thing that gets lost in this
[17:38] card is this try and go here in the
[17:40] background with the the I in the the top
[17:46] part they're very similar to this
[17:48] diagram of which is to try and go with
[17:50] the all-seeing eye on the dollar bill so
[17:58] the triangle would in the wheel
[17:59] represents the the three gunas and this
[18:07] is a symbol for them and I mentioned
[18:08] those were part of the Hindu philosophy
[18:13] and they're the three qualities the
[18:17] which are to do with the creation so
[18:22] this central I hear I think I talked
[18:28] about that at the start and the fact
[18:29] that that's often missed as being a
[18:31] really important bit because we have
[18:33] this card does represent life ebbs and
[18:36] flows and we need to have some sense of
[18:39] stillness and detachment to be able to
[18:41] make our lives the most productive which
[18:46] is where things like spiritual practice
[18:48] comes in so obviously with the Hermit we
[18:51] had this sense of withdrawing to the
[18:56] drawing in inside to our spiritual
[19:01] calling thing the thing that was most
[19:03] relevant to us and in this card it's
[19:07] more of an external application of that
[19:11] stillness so this card is very much to
[19:14] do with our our day-to-day fortunes the
[19:18] ups and downs the ebbs and flows but
[19:21] this all-seeing eye is and that
[19:25] detachment from that process of motion
[19:28] is something which is very important in
[19:30] this card
[19:30] I think obviously we've also got these
[19:34] we're at these some spirals here which
[19:39] again is the energy of the wheel coming
[19:41] forth something that I forgot to mention
[19:44] with that fist here we've got six rays
[19:46] coming out now the number six is to do
[19:49] with the six Sephiroth here which is
[19:52] ruled by the Sun as soon as to do with
[19:55] the Christ consciousness the Christ
[19:58] Center it's again the looks like the
[20:02] all-seeing eye which is the third eye
[20:04] here which is meditated upon in its way
[20:07] we see the spiritual light
[20:10] [Music]
[20:12] so the fact there are six raised there
[20:15] means that it's like the is almost like
[20:18] the the will of God the will of Christ
[20:23] is actually moving that wheel hmm and I
[20:31] touched upon that again going back to
[20:32] the original diagram here which is has
[20:34] said and doing things in the greatest
[20:37] good and so it's all about trying to
[20:41] when we turn the wheel of our life there
[20:47] are we turning it in out of it in a way
[20:49] that is far our best possible good are
[20:53] we making the most of it now we take it
[20:55] the most of our opportunities are we
[20:59] living at a life that is our spiritual
[21:00] nature it's that sort of thing that we
[21:05] can't so we need to think about so
[21:11] anything else to do this symbolism yeah
[21:15] at the center of the wheel day we've got
[21:17] a little point which is very difficult
[21:19] to see there the point is associated
[21:24] with Quetta and spirit
[21:31] so the three gunas of three qualities
[21:35] are really just emanations from this
[21:37] point of stillness
[21:38] so everything in life comes from this
[21:40] point of stillness which again is what
[21:43] makes this central portion of the wheel
[21:47] so important and again this is so often
[21:51] missed and the interpretation of this
[21:52] car so implied in this is that
[21:58] everything that happens on this wheel of
[22:00] life is God's will because it just all
[22:02] emanates from that Center it all
[22:04] emanates from Quetta from God so he
[22:13] could spend ages discussing karma and
[22:14] things like that but I think I'm going
[22:18] to stop there as I say for those that
[22:20] are interested there's links from on my
[22:22] website in the notes on this particular
[22:26] card too to various different articles
[22:28] so we'll move on to the next section
[22:30] which is to do with the transition
[22:32] between the Hermit and the fortune card
[22:34] or the Hermit and fortune cards have a
[22:38] very strong link to each other as a fool
[22:41] moves from the Hermit into the wheel of
[22:45] fortune because what he's done in ham is
[22:51] he's learned to be centered and strong
[22:56] within himself in order to follow the
[22:59] true calling and what's the most
[23:02] important thing to him so that's like an
[23:05] inner centeredness and it's this sense
[23:09] of being centered that allows us to move
[23:14] into the center of the wheel here and
[23:15] get some detachment from the
[23:21] absent flows of life so both cars close
[23:26] related and by mastering the Hermit
[23:28] within we bear able to survive the sort
[23:32] of karmic Wheel of Life
[23:33] when we move out of the inner path and
[23:37] go out into the world and that's that
[23:40] the stage pretty much summarized okay
[23:43] we'll move on to the divination aspects
[23:46] of this card in terms of its upright
[23:51] position and its divinatory meaning when
[23:55] we get the fortune card or the wheel of
[23:57] fortune it's really reminding us to be
[24:02] optimistic and have faith in the
[24:04] universe and that it will take care of
[24:08] the situation in the best possible way
[24:10] it could also mean that change is about
[24:13] to happen to us and soon so we may need
[24:17] to alter our present course move things
[24:19] in a different direction and turn the
[24:22] wheel of life in a different way to
[24:24] ensure that we're creating the best
[24:27] possible outcomes in our life so if we
[24:31] struggle against the flow of life then
[24:33] we struggle to ascend the wheel and we
[24:37] get stuck in this Typhon here or even
[24:42] crushed so despite this sort of ebb and
[24:44] flow of the wheel if we are reminded to
[24:49] bring ourselves into the center here and
[24:52] to have a sense of stillness within us
[24:56] then it's in its upright position it's
[24:59] turning us that will have a beneficial
[25:01] effect on our life
[25:04] so there is good fortune with this card
[25:07] it could mean that there's an
[25:09] opportunity coming our way soon which
[25:11] will present itself and we need to be
[25:13] ready to take that and grasp that
[25:15] opportunity it also like does imply that
[25:19] it reminds us to go with the flow of
[25:20] life as well let good fortune come our
[25:23] way being ready to act on unexpected
[25:29] opportunities and also when times are
[25:32] good enjoy them but don't become
[25:34] complacent because things can change and
[25:37] then again when times are challenging
[25:38] don't be discouraged because when things
[25:40] seem at their worst that can often get
[25:42] better so those are some of the
[25:45] divinatory meanings for this card in the
[25:47] upright position now if we turn to this
[25:52] card and look at it in the reverse or
[25:58] ill dignified position if this comes up
[26:00] in a reading like this it could mean
[26:03] that we're not going with the flow of
[26:05] life look is not on our side at the
[26:09] moment it could be terms of events that
[26:12] are coming or I've been that weren't in
[26:14] our favor
[26:17] it could also relate to circumstances
[26:20] which are out of our control we can't
[26:22] get a hand on it you can't get a grip
[26:24] with the fist on the situation so it
[26:27] leaves us feeling helpless and powerless
[26:30] it could also relate to a run of
[26:33] circumstances whereby they just seem to
[26:36] have come out of the blue and it could
[26:38] be related to food decisions we've made
[26:40] in the past or even in past lives and
[26:44] again that equally real part applies to
[26:47] the upright position whereby a good
[26:50] fortune and ease in this life can be a
[26:52] result of good decisions in the past and
[26:55] again I'm comma from past lives
[27:01] and also this sort of position of the
[27:04] card being reversed it could mean that
[27:07] and it could indicate there's a time of
[27:11] significant stress where we're not
[27:14] really dealing with the events of our
[27:15] life very well so this is not a time to
[27:18] be taking risks when the card is in its
[27:21] reverse position to conclude this video
[27:27] we'll just look at the Celtic cross so
[27:30] if the Fortuner plays in the heart of
[27:32] this situation here it could be it's
[27:35] basically saying that life is changing
[27:37] and we must be ready to act on any
[27:39] favourable opportunities if it's the
[27:43] crossing card here it could mean that
[27:45] we're taking too many risks or even just
[27:50] not going with the flow of life we're
[27:52] stagnating unconscious influences it
[27:56] could mean that we've got things in the
[27:58] past that have made a scared of change
[28:01] fearful events that have left their mark
[28:03] so we're not as outgoing and as
[28:07] free-flowing so what we could be all go
[28:10] through each one here but short term
[28:14] future change and some good look coming
[28:16] our way an opportunity for growth
[28:19] guidance and warning don't get caught in
[28:22] the up in the wheel of life too often we
[28:25] draw yourself to the center and get some
[28:27] perspective on things
[28:29] overall outcome there will be an
[28:33] excellent opportunity for change in your
[28:34] life for the better we need to go with
[28:38] the flow remain centered and focused on
[28:40] what's most important to us and it be a
[28:42] great outcome so that's the sort of
[28:44] things qualities that are associated
[28:47] with this card I hope you've enjoyed the
[28:49] video thanks ever so much for your
