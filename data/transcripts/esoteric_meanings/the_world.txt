[00:06] [Music]
[00:11] hello and welcome to this very last
[00:13] video in the major economies and we're
[00:16] going to be looking at the universe card
[00:18] we can see that that differs from the
[00:21] radaway version which is the world so
[00:24] straight away the the universe to me
[00:28] indicates that and the top deck is
[00:30] looking from a much more expanded
[00:33] spiritual perspective rather than you
[00:37] know day-to-day divinatory meanings that
[00:44] the right of way is particularly good at
[00:48] so with that said we'll get the
[00:50] divination aspect from the universe card
[00:55] out way and then for those of you that
[00:57] want to look at the more giba side to
[01:01] this card there will be a lot of
[01:02] information following if the universe
[01:07] card appears in a spread in the upright
[01:09] position it could indicate the
[01:11] completion of a project
[01:13] it means our efforts are funding paying
[01:15] off even though that the journey for us
[01:18] to get this stage may have been quite a
[01:20] long and arduous one our work is
[01:23] virtually complete and therefore we're
[01:25] going to have a great sense of
[01:27] satisfaction at finishing off and seeing
[01:31] the products of our endeavors I'm it's a
[01:35] reminder to finish what we've started
[01:37] I'm also learning to take our control of
[01:40] our own destiny and its master of the
[01:44] elemental forces that we'll talk about
[01:46] in later sections it's using the power
[01:50] of our will to get results
[01:53] and it's reaching a also a new level of
[01:56] spiritual understanding or enlightenment
[01:59] so that's some of the upright meanings
[02:03] for this particular card if the universe
[02:12] appears in a reverse or ill dignified
[02:16] position here
[02:17] it could mean procrastination and
[02:19] finishing our projects failure to bring
[02:22] closure to a situation for example could
[02:24] be a relationship or feeling towards
[02:26] someone from the past frustration at not
[02:30] being able to progress spiritually to
[02:33] the point where we know what our souls
[02:36] relationship to the universe is so this
[02:39] sense of completion can be representing
[02:44] many different levels so this serpent
[02:47] here actually dominates the maiden which
[02:49] is us so we're really sort of engulfed
[02:52] in in matter and and stuck in it it
[02:57] could be also a refusal to accept a
[02:59] situation has ended again possibly a
[03:02] relationship setting and possibly
[03:05] harping back two things have happened in
[03:08] the past that we just can't let go of so
[03:11] those are some of the divinity
[03:13] remainings of the card will now look in
[03:15] detail at the symbolism that this card
[03:18] contains and then we'll finish off with
[03:20] the application of this card in a Celtic
[03:22] cross spread a brief look now at the
[03:26] position of the universe card on the
[03:28] Tree of Life and as you can see I've
[03:30] colored it in red here and it lies
[03:33] between yes odd which is ruled by the
[03:36] moon unmarked coot
[03:37] which represents earth so my couch is
[03:41] often said is like a little pendulum
[03:43] there's not really part of the tree as
[03:46] such
[03:48] with these two Sephiroth here they both
[03:54] associated with this Middle Pillar which
[03:57] if you are familiar with the Tree of
[03:59] Life this is the most balanced pillar
[04:03] these three here are said to be
[04:07] associated with the holy trinity so
[04:10] you've got Qatar and the father tip
[04:13] earth which is the Sun which is related
[04:17] to Christ here the Sun God and also our
[04:21] Christ consciousness at the third eye
[04:23] and yes Dodd is supposed to be
[04:25] associated with deep Holy Spirit so here
[04:29] we have a very balanced position on the
[04:32] Tree of Life also we will talk a little
[04:35] bit about B now here because it's also
[04:40] associated would be non because this
[04:42] card we can see here is ruled by Saturn
[04:46] you see the sickle here and the third of
[04:54] the Sephiroth here is bernard which is
[04:57] ruled by Saturn so this particular card
[05:01] links in our earthly world with our with
[05:06] the supernal triangle which are the top
[05:10] three triangles on the Tree of Life and
[05:12] been our is like the mother which gives
[05:16] birth to all of the formed universe so
[05:22] we have this link in from the highest to
[05:26] the lowest on the tree of life and yes
[05:31] or here is supposed to like it's
[05:34] associated with fertility in the moon
[05:36] and we can see in the card here we have
[05:40] this sphere in the center which is the
[05:43] green which is representing Earth and
[05:46] it's the fertile earth is colored green
[05:49] because it's
[05:51] a fertile representation of the earth
[05:54] this car is all about enrichment
[05:56] spiritual enrichment and so again this
[05:59] links in with its position on the tree
[06:03] of life so all of these things are
[06:05] connected the Hebrew Association of this
[06:11] card is represented by this glyph down
[06:15] here and it is saying the word tow which
[06:18] is T a U and here is a larger version of
[06:26] the same thing so essentially this word
[06:30] means cross and indeed here we can see a
[06:33] town cross in Reis on here it's
[06:37] associated with well this is the
[06:40] crucifixion of Christ which et cetera is
[06:43] associated with Christ consciousness and
[06:47] the sacrifice of the five senses with
[06:51] the five wounds that yes
[06:53] so tel means cross cross is related up
[06:57] to if we draw a cross here which is very
[07:01] squiggly it's related to the number four
[07:03] the four directions we've got the four
[07:07] cherubs around the outside and this is
[07:09] related to matter because essentially
[07:12] the square is it's very solid like the
[07:16] number four so it's related to the
[07:18] material creation creation number four
[07:23] is also related cosmically to the name
[07:27] of you over Oh God which is the Lord hey
[07:31] valve and then the final hey which was
[07:34] spoken about so it's the linking of the
[07:36] microcosm and macrocosm again this
[07:44] in this particular section we'll also
[07:46] just briefly talk about the fool because
[07:49] obviously the fool is a very first card
[07:51] whereas this is the Amiga the final so
[07:55] we've got the Alpha and the Amiga
[07:56] together and together these cards spell
[08:00] the word a G H which essentially means
[08:07] essence or for want of a better word
[08:13] spirit so if we link both the fool and
[08:17] the universe together they in Hebrew
[08:21] come up with the word spirit essentially
[08:23] that means the whole of the fool's
[08:24] journey is a representation of the
[08:27] progress of the soul through matter to
[08:31] finding its release in enlightenment in
[08:34] spirit the final release there and we'll
[08:38] see the number for recurring as we go
[08:41] into greater detail in the symbology of
[08:43] this card the symbolism of this card can
[08:49] get rather complex it's all about
[08:52] squaring the circle for those of you
[08:55] that are unfamiliar with they're
[08:57] squaring the circle was essentially a
[09:04] problem proposed byes of ancient
[09:10] mathematicians and it was a challenge of
[09:14] constructing a square with the same area
[09:16] as a given circle by using a finite
[09:22] number of steps with a compass and a
[09:25] straightedge so if you think this is all
[09:28] rather abstract and has absolute nothing
[09:31] to do with spirituality well that has a
[09:33] lot
[09:34] we can see here these are symbols of
[09:38] Freemasonry in here we have this ruler
[09:43] here for drawing the squares in that we
[09:47] have the compass in this particular one
[09:51] you've got the the egg-shaped here a
[09:57] visa of vesica as it's called and we
[10:02] have this vesica here and we have the
[10:06] square with the four cherubim around the
[10:09] outside and got a circle in the middle
[10:14] squaring the circle spiritually is
[10:19] something else it was found in the 19th
[10:23] century though physically
[10:28] it's not something that can be done you
[10:31] can't ask where a circle within the
[10:34] terms that it was laid out it was an
[10:37] impossible thing the square r-e
[10:39] represents the physical world because it
[10:42] represents the four elements I think as
[10:45] I intimated in the first part of the
[10:47] video we'll come back to that number
[10:49] four so it's the four cardinal
[10:51] directions the four seasons
[10:54] so it's solid like matter whereas the
[10:57] circle represents spirit because it's
[11:00] infinite it goes out in all directions
[11:03] and these can all be linked with the
[11:07] triangle which is the Holy Trinity and
[11:13] here we've got a situation whereby we
[11:17] have two circles here Square and a
[11:20] triangle so the outer circle here would
[11:27] represent
[11:32] Brahmin Oh God the inner circle would be
[11:36] the
[11:41] Trinity the Father Son and Holy Ghost
[11:46] and I talked about that on the tree of
[11:47] life diagram with cutter tipper earth
[11:50] and yes odd all down the Middle Pillar
[11:54] we've got the square here representing
[11:58] the four directions and the solidity of
[12:01] of earth and in the center here we've
[12:07] got the individual soul and that's
[12:12] sometimes called admin and when Patman
[12:19] individual soul earth dissolves into
[12:24] brahman here the greater that is your
[12:28] true enlightenment squaring the circle
[12:34] is all about if you could actually do it
[12:38] it would mean it would mean a full
[12:42] integration of your spiritual and
[12:44] worldly self because the circle can
[12:54] merge completely with the square but the
[12:56] fact that that doesn't happen has
[12:58] indications for the universe card
[12:59] because it means and indeed the
[13:02] spiritual path completely because it
[13:03] means that even though someone may be
[13:05] enlightened that they may have realized
[13:09] and dissolved into brahman develop
[13:12] dissolved into spirit entirely and
[13:15] therefore if they're enlightened they
[13:18] have no surfaces nor edges they're
[13:21] infinite they realize have never been
[13:24] born and I realized I've never taught
[13:27] so that's quite a state but what this
[13:31] circle and square is indicating is that
[13:33] they might have that state but the fact
[13:37] that that of the circle cannot make the
[13:41] square means that they're also subject
[13:46] the loss of fate of the unit of the
[13:48] physical world it's karma and all of the
[13:52] cycles that go with it so enlightened
[13:56] people are not necessarily perfect
[13:58] people in the world my notes go on to
[14:02] describe that probably in more organized
[14:04] detail but it's very difficult to
[14:06] describe these just purely as concepts
[14:11] perhaps this diagram will help here
[14:15] where we've got Atman or the individual
[14:19] soul here we've got birth death and
[14:23] we've got the final salvation in Brahman
[14:27] here I think the reason I've gone
[14:30] through all this in this detail is that
[14:34] it is very much linked with this
[14:36] particular card sorry this is a little
[14:41] bit blurred but this is another summary
[14:44] diagram of the distinction between
[14:46] Brahman and Atman Atman related to the
[14:49] soul the real self and non material self
[14:52] has distinct from the body so this is
[14:54] definitely soul consciousness a spread
[15:00] through the body don't really like that
[15:02] is a symptom of the soul what that is
[15:05] the thing is trying to say it is that
[15:10] there is some integration between the
[15:13] off spiritual realizations and your
[15:17] earthly world and it's to do also with
[15:21] reincarnation which we saw within this
[15:23] cycle here Brahman on the other hand is
[15:27] associated with the ultimate reality so
[15:29] that's all there is which is nothing the
[15:32] foundation saw some goal of all
[15:34] existence
[15:36] so enlightenment therefore it should be
[15:40] our only or our main goal creator
[15:45] preserver or transformer and re absorber
[15:48] of everything and causes the universe
[15:54] and all beings to emanate from itself
[15:56] Tromp transforms itself into the
[15:59] universe okay I think that's about it
[16:05] for the MCU it will look at we will look
[16:11] at the symbolism and how this relates to
[16:13] the symbolism now but as I say with
[16:16] things like
[16:20] free masonry these are some of the
[16:24] highest ideals of that which is try
[16:26] attempting to square the circle which is
[16:29] yesterday with spiritual is to do with
[16:41] instead with the spiritual path even
[16:43] though many Freemasons may not actually
[16:46] take it that far on know anything about
[16:48] the symbolism of this and just how deep
[16:52] it goes and that's what this is that's a
[16:58] glyph for what it stands for
[17:01] okay we look at how all this relates to
[17:04] the card now before doing these
[17:09] symbolism I just want to go to Lord
[17:12] Marlyn tukutz book and he unravels the
[17:16] second geometry of this card really well
[17:21] so we start off with two circles and
[17:25] these are essentially the first to
[17:27] separate on the tree of Sephiroth on the
[17:31] Tree of Life and so we can leave a one
[17:33] as ketta
[17:37] and the other one which is the second
[17:42] Sephirah witches
[17:45] Hawkman
[17:49] so we have two circles coming together
[17:51] in it indeed if you can see this
[17:54] intersection here you just extend it
[17:58] here and here and you go all the way
[18:00] around you have
[18:10] the sign of the fish
[18:15] and is this section
[18:18] that we're interested in if we go back
[18:21] to the card itself it's this bit here
[18:27] around the outside and section that's a
[18:33] name I soaked up I see which mean which
[18:42] is just translated to fish bladder
[18:50] there's a lot of association between
[18:53] Christ and the fish lot of stories you
[18:56] know about these cycles been fishermen
[18:59] and catchin fish and that sort of thing
[19:00] is talking about universal astrology so
[19:08] this is the vesica Pisces which we see
[19:10] in this card around the outside here the
[19:20] next stage is to add a third a circle
[19:25] which would be bean on puppy's third
[19:32] third Sephiroth which is ruled by Saturn
[19:35] which we talked about because this card
[19:39] is ruled by Saturn here and out of that
[19:46] we get
[19:49] this shape here this is said to be like
[19:56] the component of the vagina or the
[19:59] opening of the penis so again we have
[20:02] all this sexual alchemy happening and
[20:07] you would expect that because this is
[20:08] the universe card which is representing
[20:12] the creation the next stage would is to
[20:21] add a square because this is or talking
[20:23] about the squaring of the circle
[20:26] in other words squaring of the circle is
[20:28] an
[20:33] analogy for so if the circle is becoming
[20:41] square it's an analogy for spirit being
[20:49] fully integrated into matter and
[20:54] therefore we would be
[21:00] perfect perfect spiritual
[21:09] master and person
[21:14] but there is no such thing because the
[21:19] circle cannot be squared and therefore
[21:24] our life's purpose once we reach
[21:26] enlightenment instead then do the best
[21:29] we can to square the circle and become
[21:32] the best conduit for spirituality that
[21:35] we can be but we human beings we subject
[21:38] to the laws of fate and karma and
[21:40] therefore there's no such thing as a
[21:44] perfect a spiritual person so onward
[21:48] bound what we then do is put four
[21:51] circles at each of the corners and then
[21:56] square it and here we have it a square
[22:03] vesica Pisces there and we've got a
[22:06] circle in the middle so go here it's a
[22:12] representation of the integration of
[22:16] spirit into matter okay that's our
[22:19] sacred geometry over and now we'll look
[22:23] at the what actually the little symbols
[22:27] can mean that we can see in this
[22:30] particular card just forgot to say that
[22:34] this vesica Pisces is something that
[22:36] which is seen in church windows in some
[22:40] churches and it was also featured
[22:41] prominently in like medieval portraits
[22:46] paintings and that sort of thing so it's
[22:50] not something that's abstract and from
[22:53] Christianity and also here we've got a
[22:56] gate in the chalice for gardens and the
[22:58] Surrey England and we see the two
[23:02] circles there okay we're going to look
[23:06] at the symbols now
[23:14] there is a figure in the center of the
[23:17] card here which is the maiden and I
[23:19] would say that represents us and she
[23:23] dances with this serpent here mr.
[23:26] Crowley tells us that this serpent is
[23:28] heru-ur aha
[23:30] which if you saw the previous videos on
[23:33] the Sun and the Aeon it's a form of
[23:37] Horace's special name given to Horus
[23:41] here she dances with the serpent
[23:44] although she has her foot on it so there
[23:48] is a sense of even they've been relating
[23:52] to Horus that she is like a master all
[23:55] of the energies of this particular Aeon
[23:58] her legs are crossed in the same way as
[24:02] the thumbs and children from the Sun
[24:06] card so to refresh your memory this this
[24:10] was the dancing figures in the Sun card
[24:13] though with their arms outstretched and
[24:16] is obviously a freedom there with the
[24:18] butterfly wings same here we've got this
[24:22] same sense of freedom in contradiction
[24:25] to hand man where you've got this right
[24:29] leg cross crossed over the left and this
[24:36] is very much a stock position
[24:42] so the Hebrew of this card as we
[24:45] previous taught previously mentioned was
[24:47] tau T a you which means cross and the
[24:54] maiden herself forms this cross with her
[24:58] legs and feet pointing to the four
[25:04] cherubim in the corners of the card what
[25:10] this is really indicating that she's in
[25:12] she's in balance as best as she can be
[25:14] with her earthly world disease represent
[25:20] it represent the four elements of nature
[25:25] and so we have a balance to all intents
[25:30] and purposes between the macrocosm which
[25:34] is designing the zodiac here and the
[25:36] microcosm which is her although we said
[25:39] you cannot square the circle we can be
[25:43] as much in harmony as we can as we can
[25:45] be at any one point and this does
[25:47] represent like a harmony
[25:55] the serpent does cross her second chakra
[25:59] here which is to do with reproduction
[26:00] again calling into the card we've got
[26:05] the sexual alchemy between her and the
[26:07] universe and that is essentially what
[26:09] the Thoth deck is all about so I
[26:14] mentioned about sexual alchemy she's
[26:16] essentially impregnated and so she is
[26:22] related to the Tetragrammaton because
[26:29] essentially she's the hey final but she
[26:31] comes the hey primer here which is the
[26:34] mother and so I think I talked about it
[26:37] quite a lot in the Minor Arcana where
[26:40] you have this cycle so the
[26:42] Tetragrammaton just repeats itself so
[26:45] it's just like it a never-ending cycle
[26:47] of life
[26:54] going back to the main diagram here
[26:56] we've got like a square of light around
[26:59] the maidens head here so the square of
[27:02] light radiates from her and it
[27:05] represents matter with light inside so
[27:09] she it's it surrounds her head and
[27:13] therefore it just represent her
[27:15] enlightenment but also her is the
[27:19] spiritualization of her life as well as
[27:22] like the spiritualization of matter
[27:24] going back to the four the four corners
[27:27] here
[27:28] so again her world has become completely
[27:31] spiritualize she is the color of gold
[27:37] earth is usually associated with black
[27:40] but here isn't it's it's green as I
[27:42] mentioned earlier and that's because we
[27:44] have this fertility in this card we
[27:47] associated with the moon and the
[27:51] energies of the middle pillar which can
[27:54] work at her at the top then Tipperary
[27:56] which to do with the Sun and Sun cotton
[27:59] and you got yes or here and mulku -
[28:02] which is the earth the final Sephiroth
[28:05] the serpent itself has lightened dark
[28:08] colors representing the dual nature of
[28:11] matter the good and the bad
[28:16] it also is like the sperm ejaculate
[28:20] ejaculated from the eyes we've got the
[28:22] Eye of Horus here so again we got this
[28:25] was sexual alchemy happening so in that
[28:30] sense the serpent also represents like
[28:32] the seed of creation and she's got
[28:35] control of that she's mastered his
[28:37] spiritual endeavors and she is like
[28:42] dancing and in harmony with her life
[28:53] the eye of horus here is placed next to
[28:56] the cherub associated with air so that
[29:02] would be Aquarius here we've got
[29:04] Aquarius we've got the lion here fire
[29:10] then we've got the bull Taurus and Earth
[29:14] and we got the Eagle here which is water
[29:17] so we've got the four elements around
[29:22] the outside mirror force is associated
[29:24] with the four carbon were first
[29:30] associated with the Hierophant card here
[29:35] but in this particular card we can see
[29:38] this is actual air coming out quite
[29:42] ferociously out of the nostrils and
[29:45] mouth of these four cherubim there that
[29:49] also turned to face outwards yeah
[30:01] so they're wind and the universe card
[30:05] and this represents the element of air
[30:11] and we talked about this element of air
[30:13] because air is associated with the fool
[30:15] and the fool and universe cards are
[30:19] related because the Alpha and the Omega
[30:22] of the major arcana so this is why
[30:26] you've got the cherubims looking
[30:28] different and you've got a close
[30:31] association with air from the eye of
[30:37] horus itself there are 10 rays and this
[30:40] is essentially the return emanations on
[30:49] the Tree of Life there so it's the
[30:52] universe coming into being
[30:55] I think this black center here
[30:56] enlightenment is associated with
[30:59] blackness and even Crowley talks about
[31:03] this and indeed on the meditation
[31:08] website which is the link below
[31:10] alignments associated with a black rose
[31:12] on land so it's more about that on the
[31:18] various different web sites well now
[31:22] just turn our attention to this circle
[31:25] of stars and that is the body of meat
[31:28] which we saw as the representing the
[31:33] Omega in the yum card essentially it's a
[31:37] circle of stars which surrounds that
[31:41] this maiden and serpent
[31:44] you've got three units deep there and
[31:49] there are 72 feather-like emanations
[31:53] coming from it so that's these things
[31:58] here you can see coming from it
[32:02] so two of those and you've got three
[32:05] units deep that cross is you've got one
[32:09] two three so 72 times three two hundred
[32:18] and sixteen seventy two significant
[32:23] because we talked about in a minor
[32:25] o'connor as a McCall
[32:37] these sent an thrush angels
[32:45] there are its 36 of the Minor Arcana
[32:50] cards so 36 Minor Arcana cards and we
[32:55] saw this in the wheel here where we have
[33:02] the Minor Arcana here and there was said
[33:05] to be two angels which have influence
[33:11] over each of these 36 cards one through
[33:14] the day and one at night and there are
[33:17] said in certain passages of Exodus that
[33:20] there is a lot of allegory to these
[33:24] angels here
[33:26] so I don't know not going any into any
[33:29] further detail than that but the number
[33:33] 216 it's also fine by going 6 times 6
[33:37] times 6 which is the number of the beast
[33:41] which is essentially matter or this
[33:44] square so it's the conquering of of
[33:50] matter by the attainment of the maiden
[33:53] of enlightenment and there are links to
[33:56] these 666 on my website and in the notes
[34:00] to this particular tarot card so there's
[34:04] an awful lot to this particular card and
[34:09] next here we've got this just get rid of
[34:13] this writing
[34:21] we've got the earth here which we
[34:23] described as a greener sphere within
[34:27] that we've got this light try this sort
[34:33] of triad Lubas three looped structure
[34:38] here so that can be formed it's called
[34:44] an Ibis ribbon and it can be formed by
[34:48] just looping a material around three
[34:55] times as you can see here and this shape
[34:58] in the center Crowley says contains an
[35:00] invisible Tree of Life which can only be
[35:04] seen by those that are completely pure
[35:07] in heart and it contains the whirling
[35:10] energies of the planets ruling in the
[35:12] Sephiroth's
[35:15] so it's a called a Mabus trip
[35:22] I'm the Mabius
[35:34] the strip
[35:38] with three half twists so you've got the
[35:43] half twists in each one here I just like
[35:50] the Dynamo of Earth the dimer of power
[35:53] that his Sam sustains the earth next
[36:05] down here we have a structure which is
[36:08] supposed to be the which is here the
[36:13] table of elements and we have like
[36:15] pyramid structures as well which is
[36:20] quite difficult to see but they're there
[36:25] like in pyramids and pyramid is a basic
[36:27] shape of matter again that can be seen
[36:30] for those that contact the astral is
[36:33] lots of pyramid-shaped structures within
[36:36] the light so we've got a periodic table
[36:40] of elements here
[36:44] periodic table which consists of the
[36:52] building blocks of matter and you've got
[36:54] the the pyramids which of them is the
[36:56] basic unit of matter there
[37:01] so it's essentially another
[37:03] representation of creation we now look
[37:13] at these four in detail so the Eagle
[37:17] here has 13 feathers we've got one two
[37:21] three four five six seven eight nine ten
[37:25] eleven twelve thirteen number thirteen
[37:27] links it in with the death card which as
[37:30] we saw was to do with Scorpio and so
[37:36] this is death
[37:44] the line here has 11 looks of hair we've
[37:49] got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and that
[37:56] links us in with the lust card
[38:05] attributed to a fire with the man who's
[38:14] supposed to have the numbers 1 & 7 on
[38:18] his ears so we've got one there I was
[38:21] like 7 1 & 7 is related to the star card
[38:27] and Aquarius which is the element of air
[38:34] so good air here we've got fire
[38:42] down here
[38:48] water here and here Taurus the Bull to
[38:54] do it birth one two three four five
[39:03] locks of hair number five is related to
[39:05] the heirophant which is ruled by Taurus
[39:11] so we've got earth so we've got the four
[39:13] elements here length related to the four
[39:19] Major Arcana cards
[39:25] interesting enough these are related to
[39:28] the spiritual path and combine to form a
[39:31] little cycle so under why I shall just
[39:35] get rid of all of this so with the Eagle
[39:42] there that's associated with death the
[39:54] line here with lust and therefore
[39:59] rebirth
[40:03] - was associated with the mysteries of
[40:11] life
[40:22] that's being a natural end to the cycle
[40:28] of life
[40:29] and the one that missed out was a star
[40:30] which actually goes here which was to
[40:33] two with the drones migration of the
[40:38] soul so in the star card and for those
[40:46] of you that had a look at the star card
[40:48] there was like a pay ocean to cross with
[40:50] pyramids in the background and that was
[40:52] all to do the transmigration of the soul
[40:54] so sorry didn't draw very well
[40:57] essentially for par so we we do have
[41:00] death there transmigration of the soul
[41:04] then rebirth in the lust and the
[41:09] heirophant here which is all to do with
[41:13] learning the mysteries of the law of
[41:14] life and following the you could say
[41:18] that that was following the the path of
[41:22] the fool so that's what these
[41:29] four steps mean here here here here and
[41:34] here and I think to be honest I'm gonna
[41:38] stop there because there's a bit more to
[41:41] do and this video is just getting longer
[41:43] and that we go
[41:44] okay so we'll move on to the next
[41:46] section briefly there's more in the
[41:55] notes on my website and this particular
[41:59] transition between the Aeon card and the
[42:02] universe but to all intents and purposes
[42:05] you have the element of fire here which
[42:09] we talked about the yards and the sheen
[42:11] and the cosmic fire causing change and
[42:15] in the universe you have this sense that
[42:18] you have completed your spiritual
[42:21] journey so it's fulfilling your
[42:23] potential it's using this spiritual fire
[42:27] to finally burn off all the detachments
[42:30] that you have from the world so the
[42:33] universe is using this fire that we have
[42:40] accessed in the Aeon card to its fullest
[42:43] potential
[42:44] so we've realized what our true nature
[42:46] is which is spirit so the universe card
[42:49] relates to enlightenment there's a huge
[42:53] amount of about enlightenment on the
[42:55] various websites that I'm associated
[42:57] with but terms that would describe in
[43:00] lines Myrna are there's no sense of self
[43:03] and no sense of individuality and
[43:06] separation disappears totally you have
[43:10] no location there is no forward there's
[43:12] no back there's no left up right you
[43:15] name it that
[43:17] no direction there are no limits or
[43:20] edges of barriers even if you realize
[43:23] you've never been born that you've never
[43:24] died and there's no past and there's no
[43:28] future so these are some of the things
[43:31] that are associated with enlightenment
[43:34] but these are not mental concepts and
[43:38] enlightenment realized outside of the
[43:42] understanding of the mind
[43:44] okay so we'll now go on to the final
[43:49] section which is to do with how the
[43:51] universe plays out in its more mundane
[43:54] setting which is a Celtic Cross onwards
[43:59] to the final section of this video and
[44:02] we'll look at how the universe card
[44:03] would unfold within the Celtic Cross
[44:07] situation so if it appears at the heart
[44:10] of the matter here it could mean that
[44:12] with the quieren that what matters most
[44:15] of them at this moment in time they have
[44:20] not yet completed they've recognized
[44:23] what their highest goal is the highest
[44:25] ideal what they really want but it's not
[44:28] really completed yet and therefore this
[44:31] is a recognition that they have to do
[44:33] that possible obstacles
[44:36] it could be frustration and not
[44:39] completing and fulfilling their
[44:42] spiritual potential could mean that the
[44:43] world and all of its Paul has got in the
[44:45] way
[44:47] unknown influences subconscious
[44:49] influences yearning for something deeper
[44:52] in your life of a more spiritual nature
[44:54] so this is an indication you know with
[44:57] this card coming up that the universe is
[45:00] calling the past the University PC it
[45:05] could mean a previous involvement
[45:08] perhaps in the spiritual group spiritual
[45:10] path it could mean that spiritual and
[45:14] have led to a sense of completion of an
[45:19] Enlightenment and it's so their past has
[45:23] been very fulfilling in a spiritual way
[45:29] coops and goals could mean enlightenment
[45:32] to be more of a master of your life and
[45:35] yet have a detachment from the material
[45:38] side of things the future immediate
[45:42] future to focus on completing a major
[45:44] project or spiritual quest so it's
[45:46] bringing that into the fore self-image
[45:50] not of this earthly world spiritual
[45:53] yearnings it could mean that you don't
[45:55] really feel you fit into the box of what
[46:00] social labeling has put you in
[46:04] environment could mean spiritual groups
[46:06] meditation spiritual practice that sort
[46:09] of thing generally this would be a
[46:11] supportive that card here unless it was
[46:15] reversed guidance and warning the need
[46:19] to finish major projects again beware of
[46:22] being controlled by the world and
[46:24] material outcomes it could mean that
[46:27] really your main purpose is spiritual
[46:29] and therefore we need to get on with
[46:30] that and create the space to be detached
[46:34] from all the pull of the world
[46:37] and finally overall outcome spiritual
[46:40] enlightenment completion of a piece of
[46:42] work that is of great importance to you
[46:45] and being more in control of your
[46:47] destiny so that's just some of the ideas
[46:50] in which this card may play out in
[46:52] divination okay thank you ever so much
[46:55] for watching this series what I'm going
[46:57] to do now is I'm going to be spending
[46:59] the next weeks editing the notes of the
[47:02] Major Arcana and Minor Arcana and
[47:05] whatever edits I have done I will put on
[47:08] the front of my website so you know
[47:11] which notes have been updated
[47:13] and then after that we'll follow
[47:16] probably some things on on the
[47:19] divinatory readings and the like okay I
[47:22] hope you've enjoyed it if you've got any
[47:24] questions just drop me a line take care
[47:26] bye
