[00:04] [Music]
[00:11] hi everyone and welcome to another Tarot
[00:14] video and this tutorial will be about
[00:18] the tower for those of you that haven't
[00:21] seen this card before it's a little bit
[00:25] more tricky to decipher than the
[00:29] rider-waite version because all the
[00:33] shapes seem to blend in and it's very
[00:39] much the color of orange red which
[00:42] suppose the card is ruled by Mars down
[00:45] here so we've got the tower here which
[00:50] has been destroyed by fire and we've got
[00:54] the all-seeing eye and we've got this
[00:56] the lightning flash going down and
[01:00] ending up in the bottom left corner of
[01:03] the card and we've got the Dove and
[01:07] what's called a line serpent here which
[01:10] are two representations of love so we're
[01:13] going to be talking about those two a
[01:15] fair bit the other thing in this card is
[01:19] the garrison or the men inside that have
[01:22] been thrown out of the burning Tower and
[01:25] these are not in the shape of human
[01:30] bodies they're very much crystalline
[01:32] indeed for those of you that can see or
[01:35] have seen astrally then that's where we
[01:39] begin to get and development of shape
[01:43] so this is really just reflecting the
[01:46] fact that as a result of this transition
[01:52] man is losing his identity and needs to
[01:56] shift it to something else
[01:59] pencil mmm excuse me so in the losing of
[02:02] the identity is like he's losing his
[02:05] field of reference and so therefore they
[02:10] are less human like these men but we'll
[02:15] go into that in greater detail later
[02:17] okay
[02:19] so we'll just have a quick look at the
[02:22] rider-waite card next a cursory look at
[02:27] the right-of-way card will show us that
[02:29] we have a roughly similar theme to the
[02:33] top card we've got the figures falling
[02:36] out
[02:37] I've been jettisoned out of a tower and
[02:40] we've got the flames there which again
[02:42] represents the fiery aspect of Mars
[02:45] we've got the lightning flash as we had
[02:48] before
[02:49] and the Crown's that are representing
[02:51] the ego there so we'll go into that in
[02:55] more in greater detail if we get around
[02:57] to doing a series on the right weight an
[03:03] in standing the
[03:07] totte card we can look at its position
[03:10] on the Tree of Life and it's in between
[03:12] the two separate of hoard and net side
[03:19] these are ruled by mercury here and
[03:22] Venus respectively and the to represent
[03:28] two very different things hoard is
[03:30] essentially abstract thinking and a very
[03:33] simplistic level it represents of the
[03:35] intellect and again very simplistically
[03:38] Nets I it is to do with the emotions so
[03:41] we've got this like tension between
[03:43] opposites again which is you know a
[03:47] recurring theme throughout the
[03:49] progression of the fool because all of
[03:51] assets are in fact wanting to dissolve
[03:53] into a unity so it's always going to be
[03:55] a tension there's not a bad thing at all
[03:59] something to bear in mind is that the
[04:03] two on the two levels above we got the
[04:06] Empress on the path here between banana
[04:09] and Hawk more and we've got the lust car
[04:14] between gabber and her said
[04:18] and like I said in the introductory
[04:24] section we're gonna be talking about
[04:25] this line serpent and Dolph here these
[04:28] two aspects of love and these are
[04:33] represented in the Empress we've got a
[04:36] one edge we've got the Dove here in a
[04:39] top right hand corner
[04:43] and in the Loess card we've got this
[04:46] line serpent here
[04:52] and these are represented here we've got
[04:55] the Dove here on the left and this line
[04:57] serpent here on the right so this card
[05:03] the tower is connected to these two
[05:05] cards in both its symbolism and position
[05:09] on the Tree of Life there so as I've
[05:14] indicated there on my little diagram
[05:15] we've got the Dove representing Venus
[05:18] and the Empress we've got a line serpent
[05:20] in the lust card and the tower is like a
[05:23] combination of both of those so would
[05:31] have been quite low on the Tree of Life
[05:33] the tower is really like a battlefield
[05:36] of this tension between opposites which
[05:42] is probably why we get quite a violent
[05:44] sort of reaction in this card because
[05:47] like we've been forced out of the
[05:49] position that we are occupying in our
[05:52] tower in our little life and we've sort
[05:55] of been jettisoned from it rather than
[05:58] just asked to leave and we'll see this
[06:04] play out as we go through the tutorial
[06:07] and so we look at the Hebrew Association
[06:10] of the card next the hebrew association
[06:15] of this card is paid though it's
[06:18] actually spelled PE with an apostrophe
[06:21] over the e and it means a mouse so if we
[06:28] look at the card this is and like the
[06:30] mouth of a dragon on the bottom here and
[06:32] crowley does identify this as dis d is
[06:35] which is a another name for hades which
[06:39] is the the Roman god of the underworld
[06:46] and I guess the reason that he's
[06:55] represented it this way is that the god
[06:57] of the underworld is essentially the god
[07:01] of death and in this card you have this
[07:04] tension as I mentioned before not only
[07:07] between the two Sephiroth it's separate
[07:12] between hot and outside the emotions of
[07:15] the internet you've also got this
[07:16] tension between life and death in a way
[07:18] because you've got the the death of the
[07:20] ego which is how the where we see the
[07:24] crown lost in the the rider-waite
[07:25] version and you've got this new life and
[07:28] this is this tension that plays out in
[07:31] this card the astrology of this card is
[07:36] clearly Mars and that is again a very
[07:40] destructive energy and yet is also an
[07:44] energy of purification fire is known
[07:48] throughout creation in various forms
[07:50] whether it be a physical fire that
[07:53] Kundalini Phi the cosmic fire it's all
[07:56] been written about but it is a great
[07:59] purifier so we'll next have a look at
[08:02] the symbolism and how this plays out in
[08:05] the meaning of the card so we've come to
[08:09] look at least symbolism of this card and
[08:12] I guess we better start with the tower
[08:13] itself as I indicated it is something
[08:16] which is very rigid it's also very
[08:19] protective
[08:21] so we've got this idea of in a sense
[08:24] building our own limitations it's
[08:28] something that in cases our ego is how
[08:30] it ring past not in a sense we do not
[08:34] but we have a barrier to our expansion
[08:38] of consciousness so it's our lower
[08:41] consciousness really that is trapped
[08:43] within this tower that needs to be
[08:46] destroyed if the fool needs to move
[08:48] forward it can represent you know the
[08:51] totality of our mental emotional and
[08:54] physical states of being
[08:59] and what this card is trying to do is to
[09:03] move us out of that limited
[09:05] consciousness so in the book of the law
[09:10] Crowley does talk about two types of
[09:12] love and they he essentially has two
[09:18] symbols which are of different
[09:21] manifestations of the same energy we've
[09:24] got the Dove here and we got this line
[09:28] serpent here and he indicates and I've
[09:31] got the quote in my article on the
[09:33] website about the destructive bit being
[09:37] the most potent I think it comes from
[09:41] the fact again you've got this but it's
[09:45] not just a passive thing it's something
[09:46] in this card which is I think you're
[09:51] certainly the more dominant one in this
[09:52] card it's because this line serpent is
[09:54] the most active thing and we've got all
[09:56] this Mars energy here so this is what it
[09:59] at this particular stage is doing all
[10:01] the moving in our consciousness this
[10:03] active destructive part of love
[10:09] and he identifies this as a breakfast
[10:14] which is basically a goal of Gnostic
[10:17] Christianity and he was a god again not
[10:21] solely benevolent bolsa seen as a
[10:23] destroyer of things indeed if you look
[10:25] at the Bible itself you know God's acts
[10:28] are certainly not especially in the Old
[10:31] Testament they are certainly not
[10:32] benevolent it's got you know passages
[10:37] about God going into villages and that
[10:39] mass Springs call to children
[10:41] so again that is just symbology is core
[10:46] nothing to do with the massacre of
[10:48] physical human beings it's just all it
[10:54] is just basically all the symbolic
[10:58] references so but again there's more of
[11:02] that on my website so he identifies this
[11:06] line serpent known as praxis and I've
[11:09] got a picture of him here again we've
[11:12] got these serpents there
[11:17] it comes in various different guises but
[11:21] this one's got to have a cockerel it's
[11:24] still Abraxas though you've got the Sun
[11:27] and the moon again this is this
[11:29] interplay of energy the moon being
[11:30] feminine the Sun is masculine so again
[11:35] tension of opposites there and you've
[11:37] got the warrior like dispositions of
[11:41] Mars so these are deep
[11:50] dove under serpent and why they are
[11:53] their feathered to different types of
[11:56] love and I guess it is a reminder that
[11:59] you know love is behind all of these
[12:02] acts in creation in fact it is the thing
[12:05] that that makes the thing that binds
[12:07] creation together we'll go to the I of
[12:12] Shiva here because this is quite
[12:15] definitive at the top here it said you
[12:19] know when the only of Shiva is opened
[12:21] the universe is destroyed and it's our
[12:23] limited view of the universe that is
[12:25] destroyed upon enlightenment and it does
[12:34] relate to you know things like the
[12:37] opening of the third eye and the
[12:39] revelation of the thousand petal Lotus
[12:46] there are also 27 rays coming from this
[12:49] I in the 27 Ray's relate to the position
[12:52] of the tower as the 27th pathway or
[12:57] major pathway on the Tree of Life so you
[12:59] got pathway number 27 here home the
[13:06] number 27 is illustrated with the race
[13:14] a visual representation of Shiva Shiva
[13:20] was the goddess of destruction burning
[13:23] one's karma in the fire again that's
[13:25] what we're essentially doing here
[13:27] burning through some more karma just a
[13:35] few additional details now we've got
[13:37] this lower window of the tower here
[13:40] which is divided into ten squares which
[13:43] is also the number of the tenth
[13:46] Sephiroth which is market here so that's
[13:52] the foundation and obviously the tower
[13:55] is our foundations the upper window has
[14:02] a cross again that represents barcode
[14:06] with the four elements the fire water
[14:09] air and earth which make up our physical
[14:13] mental and emotional sort of nature and
[14:17] so these again being purified in the
[14:20] fire and again mulku tea is represented
[14:23] by earth here with this cross and that's
[14:26] right down at the bottom of the Tree of
[14:28] Life which again we can see here again
[14:30] across there so
[14:34] a bit of hidden symbolism that has five
[14:38] points to it 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 which is
[14:48] hidden and the fifth one here which is
[14:50] hidden quite often these are hidden so
[14:53] you can't easily interpret them but the
[14:55] five points relate to the fifth suffer
[14:58] us here which is gabor a-- ruled by Mars
[15:04] so again that indicates the active power
[15:07] of Mars in this card I've talked about
[15:11] the figures already there's also like a
[15:15] sexual interpretation of this card or
[15:17] well there always is gonna be talking
[15:19] about sex magic here where the tower is
[15:24] erect penis the lightning flashed the
[15:26] orgasm and the figures there are these
[15:29] like jack related sperm so there you go
[15:32] wouldn't be a definition of this card
[15:35] without some Crowley sexual antics to
[15:39] throw in but in fairness this is also
[15:42] very evident in the rider-waite card as
[15:45] well all right there's nine embers of
[15:50] flames from the mouths of the deaths
[15:51] here which represents the nine Sephiroth
[15:54] which is ruled by the moon yes odd yes
[16:01] so it is really the element the the
[16:05] energy in the Tree of Life which is like
[16:07] the foundation of the tree it means
[16:10] foundation and it also represents change
[16:14] in its cycles so we have the app it's
[16:18] like an axiom which which says change is
[16:21] stability so in other words
[16:25] in order to progress we need to have the
[16:29] flexibility to adapt so there is a nod
[16:34] to that process going on here it's like
[16:39] that if we become as rigid as the tower
[16:41] then we have to go through this rather
[16:48] say traumatic process it can be
[16:51] traumatic this the moon is also to do
[16:55] with illusion which again is being
[16:57] destroyed by this removal of the tower
[17:01] there and the jettison of the figures
[17:05] here so I think that's it as far as the
[17:10] symbolism goes
[17:16] we'll move on to the next section in
[17:21] this final section we'll look at the
[17:25] meaning of the tower in terms of
[17:28] divination and its application to a
[17:31] Celtic Cross
[17:34] generally speaking for me if the tower
[17:37] appears upright in a reading then it's a
[17:42] time of turmoil destruction it could be
[17:49] a situation in which you have anger of
[17:54] things emotions like anger grief
[17:56] depression not being able to eat or
[18:00] sleep I mean this is you know quite at
[18:05] the raw end of things and it's a result
[18:08] being badly shaken up by a life event it
[18:11] may not be quite as traumatic as that
[18:12] but it can be so our little comfort
[18:18] world has gone for the time being so
[18:22] relevant situations would include
[18:24] relationship breakups loss of a career
[18:26] death of a loved one financial or health
[18:29] problems so we're looking at the quite
[18:35] a cute end of things in terms of life
[18:38] experience the important message of the
[18:43] tower card really is that within this
[18:46] disruption that just become a potential
[18:50] for a change in purification this is a
[18:55] bit like the dark night of the soul and
[18:59] what doesn't kill us makes us stronger
[19:03] in reference to the tower card we can
[19:07] see it as being in sort of equilibrium
[19:12] between the devil and star the devil is
[19:16] all about the connection to the material
[19:21] and the bond and the depth of our bond
[19:26] to the material world and the tower has
[19:29] been like thrust out of that material
[19:31] world whether it be emotionally
[19:34] physically intellectually whatever and
[19:39] star the next card really it it puts a
[19:43] bright lighting on this because it gives
[19:45] us the potential to express a much more
[19:51] harmony and spiritual insight and as a
[19:57] result of this process here but I've put
[20:00] like
[20:04] a hour ahead on both sides of this
[20:06] because this can really just also
[20:09] traumatized us to the point where we are
[20:12] retreating back into just we just go
[20:15] back into the world so we'll get a
[20:16] trauma and then just not really learn
[20:18] from it but just restore it to one side
[20:21] and just keep it as a trauma and then
[20:23] just continue on with this ever
[20:25] tightening chain of attachment to the
[20:30] world so this is quite an important step
[20:34] to thrust on to the much brighter future
[20:41] with the star to be able to let go of
[20:44] what and go with the flow of what is
[20:47] happening in this card here so the
[20:53] lightning flash really of the towers
[20:56] like a bolt out of the blue so quite
[20:58] often this situation hasn't been seen in
[21:02] our life although we might have had
[21:04] clues because there are devil card again
[21:07] is that how we attach them to the world
[21:08] and quite often our nature is just to
[21:11] keep on being attached to the world so
[21:13] along comes the tower card to force us
[21:16] to make these changes when the tower
[21:24] appears reversed for I know some people
[21:29] will then reverse the meaning of the
[21:31] tower and start pulling positives on it
[21:33] but I can't really subscribe to that for
[21:36] me doesn't feel right so for me the
[21:41] tower reversed is more to do with
[21:43] resistance to obvious change in other
[21:46] words going back to the devil it could
[21:50] represent with Mars being the God of War
[21:53] fighting and conflict actual physical
[21:55] fighting and conflict abuse physical
[21:57] emotional abuse mental abuse that sort
[22:00] of thing and the effects of the the
[22:05] upright effects lasting over a longer
[22:07] period of time it could represent
[22:11] staying in a toxic relationship over a
[22:13] period of time or in a job situation
[22:15] that you feel confined with and you know
[22:20] now things are forcing you to to act so
[22:25] it's a much more entrenched position
[22:28] than the upright version of it was also
[22:34] signifying mental and emotional
[22:35] breakdown
[22:42] with the Celtic Cross spread if the
[22:45] tower appears and the first card the
[22:48] heart of the matter is really just
[22:50] saying that the clients in a difficult
[22:53] situation which has possibly arisen out
[22:56] of the blue causing a lot of anger
[22:59] anxiety and causing forcing a major
[23:04] change in their life
[23:08] it's a crossing card the obstacle is it
[23:11] could indicate not coping but the
[23:12] stressful change in your life building
[23:14] up stress and anxiety and not really
[23:20] having the strength to make the change
[23:22] that the tower is really trying to
[23:27] encourage you to make unconscious
[23:34] influences holding on to the past fear
[23:40] and trauma which is not being looked at
[23:46] and worked through recent pass passes
[23:51] could be a sudden stressful change out
[23:53] of the blue stressful life experience
[23:56] could be the divorce of that for that
[23:58] person or a loss of a job loss of a
[24:01] career hopes and goals if the Tara piece
[24:05] here it's feeling of wanting to overcome
[24:09] those situations that you feel stuck in
[24:11] and that you don't feel as if you have a
[24:14] way powered so in other words you're
[24:16] recognizing that you've got this tower
[24:19] and then it's confining you the way
[24:22] you're looking at the life the way your
[24:24] life is and it's your desire to actually
[24:26] move out of there so in a sense that's a
[24:28] good thing because you're recognizing
[24:29] that you've built this this thing which
[24:33] just needs to go a short-term future
[24:36] again change of job relationship or
[24:39] material situation self-image here the
[24:45] tower appears they're stuck in our own
[24:47] little safe world environment it could
[24:51] actually be okay but it's just not
[24:54] serving as it's sort of outdated it's
[24:56] grew we've outgrown and the usefulness
[25:00] of where we are
[25:02] but if obviously the tower is reversed
[25:04] there then that does indicate quite a
[25:07] toxic environment but knowing here and
[25:10] really just the need to open your heart
[25:13] and Trust in a process of change and
[25:17] going with the flow of life otherwise
[25:20] you will get this repeated experience of
[25:25] the tower and overall outcome again
[25:28] learning to go with the flow and letting
[25:31] go of the past spiritual growth as we
[25:35] see will end up and positive here
[25:36] through overcoming these obstacles and
[25:40] so we can reach out into the brightness
[25:43] on and vistor that the star gives us
[25:48] okay and that's it for now dan there's
[25:50] more in the notes on the website which
[25:52] will be coming up shortly and hopefully
[25:56] see you in the next video so hopefully
[25:58] that was a bit of a help all right take
[26:00] care of yourselves and bye for now
[26:06] [Music]
[26:07] you
