# Projects Feature Development Plan

## Overview

The Projects feature will provide users with a way to organize and manage collections of materials, syntheses, and research within the Hermetic Workbench. This feature serves as a workspace management system for ongoing esoteric research and synthesis work.

## MVP Scope

For the initial MVP phase, the Projects feature will be **file-based** and **local-only**, providing core functionality while remaining simple to implement and use.

### Core Functionality

#### 1. Project Creation & Management
- **Create New Project**: Simple form with name, description, and optional tags
- **Project List View**: Display all projects with basic metadata (name, creation date, last modified)
- **Project Details**: View project information and associated content
- **Edit Project**: Modify project name, description, and tags
- **Delete Project**: Remove project and optionally associated files

#### 2. Content Organization
- **Material Collections**: Group uploaded files, URLs, and YouTube transcripts by project
- **Synthesis History**: Associate generated syntheses with specific projects
- **Session Management**: Link existing session functionality to projects
- **Project Workspace**: Dedicated view showing all project-related materials and syntheses

#### 3. Simple Navigation
- **Project Selector**: Dropdown/sidebar component to switch between projects
- **Project Dashboard**: Overview of project contents and recent activity
- **Quick Actions**: Create synthesis, add materials, view history from project context

## Technical Implementation

### MVP Architecture

```
app/
├── services/
│   └── projects.py          # Project management logic
├── ui/
│   ├── projects_panel.py    # Project UI components
│   └── project_selector.py  # Project selection widget
└── data/
    └── projects/            # File-based project storage
        ├── project_1/
        │   ├── metadata.json
        │   ├── materials/
        │   └── syntheses/
        └── project_2/
            ├── metadata.json
            ├── materials/
            └── syntheses/
```

### Data Structure (MVP)

#### Project Metadata (JSON)
```json
{
  "id": "uuid-string",
  "name": "Tarot & Astrology Research",
  "description": "Exploring connections between tarot symbolism and astrological principles",
  "tags": ["tarot", "astrology", "symbolism"],
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00",
  "modified_at": "2024-01-15T14:30:00",
  "materials_count": 12,
  "syntheses_count": 8,
  "settings": {
    "default_synthesis_type": "hermetic",
    "auto_save": true
  }
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Project Creation
1. User clicks "New Project" button
2. Simple modal/form appears with fields:
   - Project Name (required)
   - Description (optional)
   - Tags (optional, comma-separated)
3. System creates project directory structure
4. User is automatically switched to new project context

### 2. Working Within Projects
1. User selects project from dropdown/sidebar
2. All subsequent actions (uploading materials, generating syntheses) are associated with selected project
3. Project dashboard shows:
   - Recent materials added
   - Latest syntheses generated
   - Quick stats (total materials, syntheses, etc.)

### 3. Project Management
1. User can access project settings from project dashboard
2. Edit project details, manage materials, view synthesis history
3. Export project data or individual syntheses
4. Archive or delete projects when no longer needed

## Integration Points

### Current System Integration
- **Session Management**: Link existing sessions to projects
- **Material Extraction**: Associate extracted content with active project
- **Synthesis Generation**: Save syntheses within project context
- **Export Functionality**: Export individual syntheses or entire projects

### Future Database Migration Path
- Current JSON files will map directly to database tables
- File-based materials storage can migrate to database BLOBs or external storage
- Project hierarchy and relationships already designed for relational structure

## MVP Limitations & Future Enhancements

### MVP Limitations
- **Local Storage Only**: Projects stored locally, no cloud sync
- **Single User**: No multi-user support or sharing
- **Basic Organization**: Simple flat project structure
- **Limited Search**: Basic filtering by name/tags only
- **No Collaboration**: Cannot share projects or collaborate

### Post-MVP Enhancements (Database Phase)
- **Cloud Storage**: Projects stored in database with cloud sync
- **Advanced Organization**: Nested projects, categories, hierarchies
- **Powerful Search**: Full-text search across all project content
- **Version Control**: Track changes to materials and syntheses
- **Templates**: Project templates for common research patterns

### Authentication Phase Enhancements
- **User Ownership**: Projects belong to specific users
- **Sharing**: Share projects with other users (read-only or collaborative)
- **Permissions**: Fine-grained access control for project elements
- **Teams**: Group projects under team/organization structures

### Deployment Phase Enhancements
- **Multi-tenant**: Support multiple users with isolated projects
- **Backup/Restore**: Automated project backup and recovery
- **Import/Export**: Enhanced project sharing and migration tools
- **Analytics**: Usage analytics and project insights

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core MVP (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Create basic project data structures
- [ ] Implement project CRUD operations
- [ ] Add project selector UI component
- [ ] Integrate with existing session management
- [ ] Basic project dashboard

### Phase 2: Enhanced MVP (Week 3)
- [ ] Project-based material organization
- [ ] Enhanced project dashboard with stats
- [ ] Project export functionality
- [ ] Basic project search/filtering
- [ ] Error handling and validation

### Phase 3: Polish & Testing (Week 4)
- [ ] UI/UX improvements
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Migration preparation for database phase

## Success Metrics

### MVP Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can create and manage multiple projects
- [ ] All materials and syntheses are properly organized by project
- [ ] Switching between projects is intuitive and fast
- [ ] Project data persists reliably across sessions
- [ ] No significant performance impact on existing workflows

### Key Performance Indicators
- Time to create a new project: < 30 seconds
- Time to switch between projects: < 5 seconds
- Project data loading time: < 2 seconds
- Zero data loss during project operations
- User satisfaction with project organization workflow

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Data Loss**: Implement atomic file operations and backup mechanisms
- **Performance**: Monitor file I/O performance, implement caching if needed
- **Scalability**: Design with database migration in mind, avoid hard-to-migrate patterns

### User Experience Risks
- **Complexity**: Keep MVP simple, resist feature creep
- **Migration Path**: Ensure smooth transition to future database version
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Support existing sessions without projects initially

## Conclusion

This Projects feature will provide essential workspace organization for the Hermetic Workbench while maintaining the simplicity required for MVP. The file-based approach ensures quick implementation and reliable functionality, while the planned architecture supports seamless migration to more advanced database-driven versions in future phases.

The feature directly addresses user needs for organizing complex research projects involving multiple materials and synthesis iterations, making the Hermetic Workbench more powerful and user-friendly for serious esoteric research work.
